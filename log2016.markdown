git show gpio-mockup-v2~2:drivers/gpio/gpio-mockup.c

2.  show the log in gpio-mockuo-v2 branch for drivers/gpio/gpio-mockup.c
git log gpio-mockup-v2 --  drivers/gpio/gpio-mockup.c

3.  diff the two versions of gpio-mockup.c

```
Getting Rid of Zombie Processes
You can’t kill zombie processes as you can kill normal processes with the SIGKILL signal — zombie processes are already dead. Bear in mind that you don’t need to get rid of zombie processes unless you have a large amount on your system – a few zombies are harmless. However, there are a few ways you can get rid of zombie processes.

One way is by sending the SIGCHLD signal to the parent process. This signal tells the parent process to execute the wait() system call and clean up its zombie children. Send the signal with the kill command, replacing pid in the command below with the parent process’s PID:

kill -s SIGCHLD pid

However, if the parent process isn’t programmed properly and is ignoring SIGCHLD signals, this won’t help. You’ll have to kill or close the zombies’ parent process. When the process that created the zombies ends, init inherits the zombie processes and becomes their new parent. (init is the first process started on Linux at boot and is assigned PID 1.) init periodically executes the wait() system call to clean up its zombie children, so init will make short work of the zombies. You can restart the parent process after closing it.

If a parent process continues to create zombies, it should be fixed so that it properly calls wait() to reap its zombie children. File a bug report if a program on your system keeps creating zombies.
```

2.  <http://www.linuxnix.com/how-to-kill-defunct-or-zombie-process/>
```
How can I kill a defunct process?
And : Just use kill command
#kill defunct-pid

Still not able to kill?
Ans : Then use kill -9 to force kill that process
#kill -9 defunct-pid

Still have an issue in killing it?
Ans : Then try to kill its parent id and then defunct.
#kill parent-id-of-defunct-pid
Then
#kill -9 parent-id-of-defunct-pid
```

Hi, Ryan, Maxim

Someone in France is intertested in ILP32 toolchain from linaro. I could find
a toolchain built by Maxim[1] which (I guess) base on the v3 of patches of
kernel headers and corressponding glibc.

I am also take a look at this wiki[2], But I do not find the toolchain.

Where could I find ilp32 toolchain or is there a plan to provide (not for
release, just for the developer or who is interested in it) with recently
glibc[3](Although it may be not consistent with the lastest patches from
kernel).

Regards

Bamvor

When inside the git log, type -N or --LINE-NUMBERS if you’re feeling particularly masochistic (source). This will make the line numbers appear, and you’ll lose half your terminal window to leading whitespace on those numbers.

arm, kernel, perf, backtrace
----------------------------
Some notes on try to get callgraph for an arm application on arm64 kernel.
TODO: I could get the backtrace for an aarch64 app. but fail for aarch32 app. And I do not know why.

1.  If I want to enable frame pointer I need to enable it explicitly. Because It is disabled by default after gcc 4.6 according to gcc manpage.
```
       Starting with GCC version 4.6, the default setting (when not optimizing for size) for 32-bit GNU/Linux x86 and 32-bit Darwin x86 targets has been
       changed to -fomit-frame-pointer.  The default can be reverted to -fno-omit-frame-pointer by configuring GCC with the --enable-frame-pointer configure
       option.
```

2.  perf save the stack with perf perf_callchain_user.

3.  Behavior of pop and push.
    1.  push:
        At the end: sp will be located at the lowest address with register value stored.
        sp = sp - 4 * number_of_reg
        from lowest address, store reg from i = 0 to 14 and save pc as the last register

    2.  pop:
        At the end: sp will above the highest address with register value stored.
