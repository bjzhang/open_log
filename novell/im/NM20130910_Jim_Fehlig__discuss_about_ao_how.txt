Hi

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 10:58:25 AM)
hi

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 10:58:56 AM)
I had to handle some security bugs on Friday and didn't get a chance to look at your patches and related email

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 10:59:38 AM)
but I did spend some time looking today

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 10:59:47 AM)
thanks.

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:00:51 AM)
I refreshed your old job patch that implemented libxlDomainObjBeginJob and friends

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:01:55 AM)
so I could actually try to implement your ao_how event approach with jobs support

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:02:26 AM)
IMO the event approach would be better than the callback one

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:02:42 AM)
at least that is my initial impression

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:03:12 AM)
but I need to play with it some more before I can respond to your mail

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:04:16 AM)
I probably spent too much time thinking about different approaches today and really need to just do some coding and testing

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:05:07 AM)
I started hacking some code before leaving the office but will have to finish tomorrow

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:06:00 AM)
I have several meetings tomorrow, so hopefully there are no other urgent issues so I can work on this stuff

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:07:04 AM)
anyhow, my thought is to use a cond variable to signal async op completion

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:08:13 AM)
signal the condition when event type OPERATION_COMPLETE is received

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 11:08:23 AM)
from libxlEventHandler to the long running api? e.g. save.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 11:08:32 AM)
got it.

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:08:35 AM)
right

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:09:22 AM)
e.g. during save, it will wait for the cond to be signaled from the event handler

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:09:39 AM)
same for start

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:09:53 AM)
I'll start with start in fact :)

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:10:10 AM)
try to get start working with ao_how

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:11:05 AM)
currently, you can't e.g. list domains while start is running

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:11:27 AM)
with jobs support + ao_how, that should be possible

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:11:48 AM)
then wiring stuff up for the other long running ops should be easy

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:12:38 AM)
I hope to get something going tomorrow, then maybe we can talk about it around this same time

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 11:13:29 AM)
ok. thanks. 

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:14:07 AM)
I was trying to understand how all this works in the qemu driver

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:14:27 AM)
but the qemu monitor is a different beast than libxl

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 11:14:45 AM)
there is another aop_console_how supported by libxl. for auto connected console after domain boot. but libvirt do it by itself, so, we do not use it in libxl driver?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 11:15:18 AM)
yesh. maybe because qemu is a standalone process not a library like libxl?

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:15:25 AM)
not sure, haven't thought about that :)

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:15:31 AM)
right

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:17:10 AM)
Hmm, I haven't tried 'virsh start dom --console'

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:17:25 AM)
does that work in the libxl driver since we merged your console patch?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 11:17:39 AM)
and there is ctx for libxl. so, we do not need the monitor things?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 11:17:46 AM)
i am not test yet. 

Jim Fehlig (Sep 10, 2013 11:17:53 AM)
I've done a lot of 'virsh start dom; virsh console dom', but not the combined one

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 11:18:03 AM)
in fact, i found virsh destroy fail. i am checking it why.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 10, 2013 11:25:08 AM)
i will try the console with my ao_how.
