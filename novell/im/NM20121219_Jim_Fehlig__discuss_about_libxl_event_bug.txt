hi

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 19, 2012 11:05:10 PM)
there is a pair virObjectRef and virObjectUnref  in libxlXxxCallback. but it will lead to de register twice. it will be ok if i remove the virObjectUnref in these function. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 19, 2012 11:05:33 PM)
i do not understand why. seem the reference count is wrong for some reason. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:06:34 PM)
hmm, ok

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 19, 2012 11:06:53 PM)
secondly, i found that sometimes libxlRemoveEventFDRegistrationInfo will lead to seqfault, seems that the pointer libxlOSEventHookInfoPtr is wrong, but i do not find the point when reading the code.

as mentioned, I only compile tested the patch so there are probably some bugs

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:08:39 PM)
I'll work on it today, with your findings in mind, and hopefully have a useful patch by the end of the day :)

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:09:00 PM)
did you make any other changes to the patch?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 19, 2012 11:09:17 PM)
nope.

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:10:50 PM)
ok, thanks

meanwhile, i thought i do not got your point about list of regsitered timeot and fds. could u please explain for me? 
i guess if we want the prevent the free libx_ctx, why don't we just using the ref/unref in u patch? 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:16:57 PM)
libxl removes some of the fd registrations in libxl_ctx_free

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:18:16 PM)
when that happens, the fd will become 'readable' in the libvirt event loop, which invokes the fd callback

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:19:10 PM)
the callback wants to call libxl_osevent_occurred_fd(), but we are in the process of free the libxl_ctx

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:19:46 PM)
so we have to remove all of these registrations from the libvirt event loop before calling libxl_ctx_free

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:20:06 PM)
does that make sense?

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:21:03 PM)
on my first attempt at this patch, I just did a refcount on the libxlDomainObjPrivate object when libxl registered an fd or timeout

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:21:38 PM)
but since libxl only deregisters some fd's when the libxl_ctx is freed, that approach didn't work

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 19, 2012 11:22:59 PM)
yeah. got it. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 19, 2012 11:23:49 PM)
thanks. i am going to leave. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 19, 2012 11:24:26 PM)
and if u have lastest patch today. i'd like to read and test it. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:24:39 PM)
ok, have a good night

Jim Fehlig (Dec 19, 2012 11:24:55 PM)
I'll send you the patch later, so you will have it in the morning

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 19, 2012 11:25:08 PM)
ok. 88
