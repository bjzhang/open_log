Hi, Jim. I am ready. we could have a talk when you prefreed. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:01:27)
do you received me email? i am do suse whether i discribe my status clearly or not. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:02:44)
yeah, got your mail

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:02:47)
thanks

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:04:03)
as for the xen related part, it sounds like Ian Campbell will take a patch to get the console info you need

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:04:35)
he says "I think I'd be happy to make a freeze exception for a patch which implemented the returning of an IDL struct representing the console device for the benefit of libvirt"

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:05:55)
but instead of returning a string, return an IDL struct containing the console device info

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:07:34)
similar to the way libxl_device_disk_getinfo(), libxl_device_nic_getinfo(), etc. do

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:08:22)
yeah, does he mean he maybe ack my patch before 4.2 release?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:08:24)
 return a struct will affect more code in xen and libvirt than my current patch. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:09:27)
right, but that seems to be the approach Ian wants

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:09:50)
if you do it that way, he will add it to xen4.2

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:10:42)
got it. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:11:21)
how about priority? 4.2 is almost release, should i update my xen patch first? 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:11:34)
yes, definitely

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:11:47)
you'll need to get that done before anything else

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:12:16)
ok.

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:12:33)
if you wait too long, he wont accept it

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:13:03)
maybe even respond to his mail saying that you are working on his suggested approach

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:13:14)
so he knows it will be coming

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:13:43)
ok. i could reply to him today. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:15:52)
as for the libvirt side of your console work, it should be pushed off to the xen4.2 version of the libxl driver

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:16:52)
xen4.1.x will not contain your xen patch, so no use doing the libvirt side

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:17:17)
we could backport it, but that doesn't make much sense

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:18:22)
I'm also not sure about the best way to handle the migration patch

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:19:08)
you could continue implementing it against xen4.1.x, but it is a big patch

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:19:19)
and how much of it changes with xen4.2?

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:19:39)
maybe it would be better to get the libxl driver working with xen4.2

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:19:46)
then add these new features to it

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:20:00)
and just leave the 4.1 driver as is

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:20:31)
if users want the new features, update to xen4.2 and a libvirt with the new driver

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:20:44)
for migrate itself, only function or struct change something. it is easy to switch between 4.1 and 4.2 for migration patch. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:20:57)
ah, ok

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:21:27)
it looks like update libvirt libxl driver from 4.1 to 4.2 will take more time than libvirt libxl migration patch. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:22:19)
did you see that someone posted a libvirt patch to make the libxl driver work with xen4.2?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:23:04)
yes. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:23:59)
he ignored the fact that the driver needs to work with 4.1 and 4.2

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:26:04)
Ian Campbell also made a suggestion in that thread:"That doesn't really help with support 4.1 and 4.2+. A large portion of the below looks like it would be reasonably easy to abstract away with a header full of compat defines for naming changes etc, other bits don't look so simple to deal with"

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:27:01)
Maybe Daniel De Graaf will work on it, but I wouldn't count on it :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:28:25)
got it.  i read the patch again. i understand that support 4.1 and 4.2+ is important for this patch. but it will it be handle. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:28:50)
and I warried about the other thing. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:29:18)
about the event machanism. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:30:28)
xen4.2 change the event machanism which mean libvirt can not the    file descripter from xen api directly. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:33:06)
but libvirt event handle system is used everywhere in libvirt.  in Daniel De Graaf patch, it looks like he give up the libvirt event machanism and made a specific event handle machanism for libvirt libxl only. I guess it is not a good way. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:38:42)
Hmm, I'm not sure

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:39:02)
it looks like he adds and event fd with virEventAddHandle()

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:41:23)
Oh. i do not read the patch carefully. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:42:13)
maybe you can continue with the migration patch for 4.1

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:42:58)
once it is upstream, then work on the 4.2 support if Daniel De Graaf hasn't provided an updated patch

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:43:23)
ok. this is what i want to say. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:44:46)
I think the migration patch will be two parts though

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:45:35)
first you will need a patch that make the libxl driver locking similar to qemu

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:46:08)
then the migration patch can make use of the proper locking

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:47:15)
the two patches aren't even related actually

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:47:33)
the first one just improves locking in the libxl driver

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:48:06)
it will be useful in general and should still apply to xen4.2

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:48:46)
does that make sense?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:48:51)
ok.  i see the discuss about lock in maillist list and i am not  working on it yet.  i do not know whether the migration patch must need the new lock or not. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:50:00)
do there any chance make migration work without new lock? i think so. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:51:04)
yes, I think so too

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:51:17)
the drive will just be locked during the migration operation

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:51:31)
i mean i do not know how does the lock status. and how much lock need to add in libxl. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:52:32)
We need locking like Eric Blake mentioned in that thread:"See src/qemu/THREADS.txt.  That gives the details on how to drop thedriver lock and even the domain object lock, by maintaining a referencecount and job condition on each domain to ensure that others can stilluse the driver, just not for the domain whose job is still occupied."

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:53:58)
Hmm, IMO the locking improvements should be done first

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:54:29)
migration would be the first useful, long-running operation in the driver

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:55:17)
so users would be more likely to see cases where the driver is locked doing a migration and cant do anything else

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:56:16)
yeah. i see Eric email. and i read the qemu THREADS.txt. there are lots of locks in qemu than libxl. do you mean i need to add lots of lock in libxl? 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:57:11)
So, i need understand the migration sequence. and which lock it need. then adding new lock in libxl? 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:57:31)
well, just enough to be able to do things like migrate a domain and at the same time get info on another domain, or start another domain

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 8:58:06)
with the current locking, you would have to wait for the migration to complete before doing anything else, even on a totally different domain

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 8:58:28)
ok. got it. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 9:00:05)
the libxl driver already has the same thing as struct qemud_driver: RWLock

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 9:00:22)
and it uses the  virDomainObjPtr:  Mutex

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 9:01:41)
the libxl driver needs the functionality described under "qemuMonitorPrivatePtr: Job conditions" in THREADS.txt

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 9:02:07)
Bo Yang wants to eat so we are going out to dinner now

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 9:03:21)
ok. i will think about what you said. if i have question i will send you email or talk on IM. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 9:03:25)
thanks. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 9:03:52)
you know i am fimiar with something you mentioned. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 9:03:58)
you know i am not  fimiar with something you mentioned. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 9:04:05)
sorry typo.

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 9:04:41)
first though, remember to take care of the patch for upstream xen

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 9:04:48)
that one is time-critical

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 9:05:07)
better locking in the libvirt libxl driver and support for migration can come in time

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 9:05:37)
yes. i understand. 4.2 almost release. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-5-18 9:06:32)
ok, have a good day

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-5-18 9:06:45)
ok. thank you.
