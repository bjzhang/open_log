Hey, just wanted to let you know that I found the source of the libxl assertions/segfaults

Jim Fehlig (Dec 17, 2012 1:02:07 PM)
when destroying or shutting down a domain, there is a race between destroying the libxlDomainObjPrivate object (which frees libxl_ctx) and processing the timer callbacks

Jim Fehlig (Dec 17, 2012 1:03:01 PM)
so the libxlDomainObjPrivate object gets freed before calling libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout

Jim Fehlig (Dec 17, 2012 1:03:13 PM)
and we assert or bomb in libxl

I'll spend some time tomorrow hacking up a patch to fix this

will have to figure out how to restructure the libxlDomainObjPrivate object so that we can use virObject

Jim Fehlig (Dec 17, 2012 1:04:58 PM)
then ref/unref to ensure the object isn't cleaned up until all references are dropped

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 17, 2012 1:05:21 PM)
ok.
