hi. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:16:56 PM)
Hi Bamvor

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:17:20 PM)
I was going to see if you were around tonight

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:17:28 PM)
my tonight, your tomorrow :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:17:49 PM)
it is ok for me. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:18:09 PM)
right now is ok too. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:19:03 PM)
the patch i sent to you is not a good one. lack some line from my original patch. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:19:51 PM)
I think it would be best to just use the normal git workflow for creating these patches

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:20:58 PM)
e.g. from http://libvirt.org/hacking.html

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:21:44 PM)
then you can send me patches with proper commit msg, etc.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:21:53 PM)
yes. i understand. but I need to reverse the migraiton and lock patch. I do it manaully, and obviously missing something. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:21:56 PM)
and have them ready for pushing upstream

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:23:12 PM)
ok. and I prepare patch like your link from this week. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:23:26 PM)
IMO, you should have 2 branches, one for locking (with 2 patches in it), and one for migration

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:25:46 PM)
so something like:
git checkout master
git pull
git branch libxl-lock
git checkout libxl-lock
work on lock impl
git add <changed files>
git commit
git format-patch ...


Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:26:21 PM)
OK. thanks. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:26:38 PM)
when sending to libvirt ml directly, you can use 'git send-email ...'

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:26:57 PM)
git send-email takes most of the option that git format-patch does

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:27:15 PM)
I do the similiar thing right now except only one branch. I will do as your suggection. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:28:35 PM)
yeah, with different branches, you can work on the patches separately

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:29:31 PM)
using that workflow, you can send me patches in the same form as they will eventually be sent upstream

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:30:08 PM)
that way I (or others) can comment on e.g. the commit msg too

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:31:30 PM)
got it. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:32:15 PM)
I've briefly looked at the lock impl, but need to go through it again spending more than just a few minutes reviewing it :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:33:33 PM)
i will send you the newer version tomorrow. which fix some errors. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:34:09 PM)
I got another problem rigt now. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:34:32 PM)
after i move my patch to libvirt upstream. the migration is not work. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:34:56 PM)
I am debugging it. but i do not found the reason right now. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:36:18 PM)
I will send the newer the lock patch to you. then continue to debug migration. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:36:38 PM)
It looks like i need to understand the migration more deeply. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:38:07 PM)
ok, sounds good

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:38:43 PM)
I think we should get the lock patches done first, and get those pushed upstream

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:38:52 PM)
then work on migration

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:39:23 PM)
Yes. I agree. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:40:24 PM)
i arm just not comfortble while the migration is not work. it should be work. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:40:51 PM)
yeah, that is odd

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:41:06 PM)
something must have changed upstream that now breaks you patch

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:41:51 PM)
maybe. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:43:10 PM)
do you have some suggestion after take a look my lock patch? 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:43:51 PM)
i could update my patch accoring to your suggestion then send the new version to you. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:44:01 PM)
no, but as I said just briefly looked at it

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:44:41 PM)
I'll try to spend some time looking more closely today and give some feedback before your morning

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:46:28 PM)
yes i understand. there are some obviously error in that patch. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:47:00 PM)
how about i send a new patch to you. right now. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 10:47:14 PM)
i do not want to waste your time. 

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:47:25 PM)
ok, sounds good

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:47:46 PM)
I'll look at the new patch today and give you some feedback on that

Jim Fehlig (Aug 23, 2012 10:48:34 PM)
and maybe we can chat more tomorrow about it (later tonight for me)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Aug 23, 2012 11:11:30 PM)
