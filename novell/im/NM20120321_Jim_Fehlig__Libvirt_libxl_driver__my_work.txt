Hi Bamvor :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:41:24 AM)
hi, jim

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:43:14 AM)
have you made any progress on libvirt libxl driver for xen-unstable?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:44:13 AM)
not yet. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:45:02 AM)
i am doing something about GSoC project. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:45:39 AM)
there is  a student interested in the libvirt libxl driver idea which i post in the openSUSE GSoC idea list. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:47:25 AM)
I thought you want me finish the libvirt libxl driver through GSoC project. So, I did not do more works on it. 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:48:13 AM)
there is plenty of work to do on the libvirt libxl driver

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:48:24 AM)
Meanwhile, I discuss with Chunyan Liu, and I found that there are some problem in live migration with Chunyan's patch. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:48:28 AM)
yes, i understand. 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:48:35 AM)
making it work with libxl in xen-unstable is just one of many things to do

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:48:45 AM)
yeah. 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:49:05 AM)
the driver needs to have the same functionality as the legacy xend driver

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:49:24 AM)
in theory, it should have more functionality

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:49:44 AM)
e.g. add migration function in libxl by Chunyan? 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:49:51 AM)
right

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:50:29 AM)
you can just look at the driver function table and see all that is missing compared to the xend driver

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:50:38 AM)
ok. 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:50:41 AM)
the qemu driver has the most functionality

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:51:02 AM)
ok. i will compare the libxl, xend and qemu driver in libvirt. 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:51:05 AM)
it would be good if the libvirt libxl driver gained a lot of the functionality the qemu driver has

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:51:13 AM)
where it makes sense of course

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:52:05 AM)
as for Chunyan's migration patch, I don't know if she will get that done before her maternity leave

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:52:27 AM)
if so, I hope she can transfer that to you

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:52:46 AM)
yeah. For Chunyan's patch. Chunyan had discuss with me. 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:53:15 AM)
I would ask her about the status of it, but she is not online

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:53:33 AM)
She send the patch to me. and tell me there are some problem in live migration. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:54:14 AM)
So, She wonder if i can continue to work and try to fix the live migration problem. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:54:39 AM)
She think it it a good choice of me to take over her work while she leave. 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:54:54 AM)
yes, I agree

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:55:25 AM)
have you followed the upstream discussion on this patch?

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:55:45 AM)
A few of the redhat folks have also made suggestions

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:55:51 AM)
yes. I read the e-mail.

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:56:02 AM)
those will need to be addressed before the patch can be committed

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:56:34 AM)
you mean Daniel P. Berrange and Eric Blake? 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:56:40 AM)
yes

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:57:10 AM)
ok. 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:57:22 AM)
they are the primary maintainers of libvirt

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 11:57:51 AM)
I have commit rights and can ACK patches, but they generally rule the project :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 11:59:21 AM)
i understand. So, I need to update code and get their ACK either. 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 12:01:22 PM)
I can ACK and commit it once I feel comfortable with the patch

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 12:02:09 PM)
but that means addressing Daniel and Eric's comments

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 12:02:39 PM)
Actually, Eric just pointed us to some documentation about how qemu handles threading and locking

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 12:03:06 PM)
it might be useful in solving the locking problems that I was seeing

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 12:03:45 PM)
sure. 

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 12:05:14 PM)
there is a lot of work to do in that driver

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 12:05:33 PM)
hopefully you can find something interesting

Jim Fehlig (Mar 21, 2012 12:05:42 PM)
feel free to email if there are any questions

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Mar 21, 2012 12:07:14 PM)
ok/
