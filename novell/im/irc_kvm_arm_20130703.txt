<agraf> maz_: ping :)
<agraf> maz_: bamvor wants to start looking into A7 support for KVM
<agraf> maz_: and I don't remember the details on what was missing for that
<maz_> agraf: pong
<maz_> agraf: we need a new backend, go through the A7 specifics that we need to emulate hopefully very little)
<agraf> maz_: there he is! :)
<agraf> maz_: so when bamvor has questions to any particular specifics, would you mind helping him out?
<maz_> Sure.
<agraf> maz_: thanks a bunch :)
<maz_> agraf: so worries.
<maz_> agraf: do you have a particular platform target in mind?
<agraf> maz_: sunxi A31
<maz_> agraf: of course, to be able to help you, I'll require the same platform on my desk... ;-)
<agraf> maz_: haha :) I don't have one myself either
<bamvor> maz_: i am not familiar with kvm. i need to do it more than adding a7 in  kvm_target_cpu, but  i do not know other works.
<maz_> bamvor: the biggest task is to look in the A7 TRM and find out what are the cp15 operations we need to trap if any.
<bamvor> maz_: do u mean the trap in hyp mode? i guess than most of it is identical with ca15. but i need check it one by one. 
<maz_> bamvor: I don't expect that to be a very long task anyway, but that's a good ramp-up for playing with KVM.
<apritzel> maz_: can't one take a VExpress TC2, move the A7s to cluster 0 and disable the A15s to get a pure A7 system?
<apritzel> Which would then be similar to a sunxi A31 in terms of A7 enablement?
<agraf> apritzel: pssh - he's trying to get his hands on hardware
<maz_> apritzel: of course. I'm just trying to con agraf into sending me more toys! ;-)
<agraf> maz_: :)
<apritzel> IC ;-)
<agraf> maz_: but really, bamvor is looking at this from a community perspective - I don't have any connections to sunxi whatsoever
<bamvor> maz_: So, i need create a coproc_a7.c in kvm and trap thing? 
<maz_> bamvor: yes, but only trap things if required.
<maz_> bamvor: I don't think there is much to trap anyway, but you need to make sure.
* Bamvor1 (~Bamvor@117.136.0.248) has joined #kvm-arm
<maz_> bamvor: I'd expect a slightly tweaked A15 KVM to work fairly OK.
<apritzel> bamvor: famous last words ;-)
<apritzel> we had issues with writing HSCTLR to the A7 in a TC2 chip
<maz_> apritzel: that's part of the fun.
<apritzel> question is whether we really need a separate coproc_a7.c
<apritzel> the code in there looks quite generic, I guess the overlap is very big
<apritzel> for registers that differ much like ACTLR we only care about one bit (SMP), which is the same between both
* apritzel has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
<Bamvor1> apritzel: yes. we have discuss it a month earlier.
<Bamvor1> maz_: where could i get the lastest kvm-arm code, the github code seems out of date.
<Bamvor1> maz_: i am using my mobile phone right now.
<maz_> Bamvor1: use mainline. everything is there.
<Bamvor1> maz_: thanks.
<maz_> Bamvor1: no worries.
* Bamvor1 has quit (Quit: Bye)
<XavierGr> Do you guys have another A7 platform other than the TC2? My quick testing of kvm on A7 worked ok at the time, save for the 3rd A7 which crashed whenever it tried to write to HSCTLR. At some point it would be good to know if it was hardware related or some other omission

<XavierGr> pm215: I am trying to test the recent virtio changes that you posted. On the qemu arguments you provide an -sd image file, then a separate qcow2 image file. Also the boot argument for the kernel is mmcblk0 (instead of the previously used /dev/vda).
<maz_> XavierGr: no, TC2 is the only A7 platform we have. I have an A20 box on my desk, but still need to solder console access and find a suitable kernel that'd work on it...
<XavierGr> maz: A20? that seems interesting...
<maz_> XavierGr: dual A7, apparently. But I gave up trying to find a recent kernel/bootloader for this. If Maxime manages to get mainline running on it, I'll have a look again.
<XavierGr> maz: something like this: http://www.cnx-software.com/2013/06/19/cubieboard2-powered-by-allwinner-a20-is-now-available-for-59/

<mgalgs> bamvor: we're also looking into kvm support for A7 here at QuIC (msm8226) so I guess we're in good company :)
<afaerber> mgalgs, is KVM working on the Snapdragon s4? (the Qualcomm guys at LinuxCon never got back to me)
* neonum6 has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
<mgalgs> afaerber: someone said they "sort of" got it working on Qualcomm hardware. We're putting some more resources into it now...

<agraf> is anyone running an arndale board?
<agraf> i can't seem to run zImages, uImage works fine
<agraf> zImage crashes before any console output
<agraf> ojn: ping? :)
<ojn> agraf: ?
<agraf> ojn: aha! :)
<agraf> ojn: you're involved in exynos5 things, right?
<ojn> agraf: I only use uImages too
<ojn> a bit
<agraf> ojn: ah, uImage only obviously means you don't know
<agraf> meh
<ojn> the arndale main kernel person is tusharb on #linaro-kernel
<agraf> ojn: what time zone is he in?
<ojn> india somwhere, I suspect
<agraf> so I'd hope he's asleep now :)
<ojn> he should be getting up soon, I suspect
<ojn> oh, 4.30am there now. yeah, not yet
<agraf> right :)
<ojn> agraf: going to dublin next week?
<agraf> the surprising bit really is that uImage works just fine
<agraf> ojn: nope, my talk proposal got rejected
<ojn> agraf: about kvm?!
<agraf> ojn: aarch64
<ojn> hm
<agraf> ojn: mostly about our qemu-linux-user port of aarch64 and how that helped bringup of opensuse on there
<ojn> didn't know they even had a cfp
<ojn> Oh, yeah, using and enabling opensource tools is no longer of interest for linaro.
<agraf> *shrug* i don't know whether it was an official cfp either
<ojn> at least that's my perception from the side lines. :-)
<agraf> yeah, that one was quite obvious :)
<agraf> obviously the interesting data behind that talk would've been performance data on how fast you can get with an emulator
* neonum6 has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
<agraf> but I've never really been impressed with the whole linaro thing anyways :)
<agraf> so i don't really mind all that much
<agraf> it's a shame i don't get to meet all the nice folks going there though ;)
<ojn> yeah, that's the main use of going there
<agraf> not sure, i could probably just push hard to go there if there's a compelling company reason
<agraf> i just haven't found it yet ;)
<agraf> drinking beer with nice people doesn't really count usually
<ojn> right. my main motivation is usually to keep an ear to the ground about what's going on, but linaro is going in a weird direction these days
<agraf> oh? tell me more :)
<ojn> meh, just the whole uefi business, etc.
