hi, Jim. it is bamvor

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:27:14 AM)
do you have a minute? i want to confirm about my further work. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:33:57 AM)
oh, just saw your question

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:34:20 AM)
I just sent and email to clarify what I said on the phone :)

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:34:34 AM)
s/and/an

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:34:42 AM)
realy? i have not the check the email. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:34:48 AM)
i will check it right now. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:35:15 AM)
I just sent it, like 1 minute ago :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:38:11 AM)
i received u email. reading. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:42:54 AM)
i add a api in xen libxl for my libvirt libxl driver. it is a new api in xen libxl. i use this api to get the pts number from xenstore. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:43:47 AM)
ok

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:44:09 AM)
i think it is necessary because libvirt xen driver read the number from xenstore directly. which is not permited by xen libxl drvier. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:44:32 AM)
right

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:44:47 AM)
then I would defer doing #1 in the email

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:45:04 AM)
you will need to get the xen patch upstream first

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:45:22 AM)
you should do that as soon as possible

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:45:33 AM)
hopefully it could be included in Xen 4.2

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:46:02 AM)
yes i understand. i will send it today. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:46:52 AM)
you can add the libvirt console patch after making the libvirt libxl driver work with xen4.2

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:47:12 AM)
so new priorities:

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:47:25 AM)
1. get xen patch upstream

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:47:51 AM)
2. migration patch

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:48:03 AM)
3. libxl V2 patch

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:49:03 AM)
4. your console patch for libvirt libxl V2 driver

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:49:29 AM)
5. other missing function in libvirt libxl driver

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:49:43 AM)
functions

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:49:45 AM)
Ok. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:51:02 AM)
I think it will be fun work :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:51:15 AM)
meanwhile, i am not suse if i could send migration v2 patch soon. because i do not have deep understand about libvirt migration sequence and chunyan' patch. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:51:50 AM)
it looks like the lock used by chunyan' patch need to update. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:52:01 AM)
yes

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:52:12 AM)
and i am not fimiar with the lock in libvirt either. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:52:15 AM)
Eric Blake made a suggestion in the email thread

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:52:27 AM)
use an approach similar to qemu driver

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:52:31 AM)
yes. ref qemu doc. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:53:01 AM)
right - src/qemu/THREADS.txt

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:53:13 AM)
yes. i will do it as you hope. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:54:05 AM)
i just not suse when can i finish it. maybe two weeks. i don't know.

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:54:09 AM)
Daniel Berrange also had some comments that need to be addressed

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:54:44 AM)
yeah, since you are just learning this code I think it will take a few weeks

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 10:55:25 AM)
especially since you will have a short week with the holiday

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:57:36 AM)
yes. about the holiday. my apologies. I want to leave for more 4 days. after holiday. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:59:10 AM)
i want to go the my parent-in-law home to see my daughter. from 4.30-5.7. So, i need to 4 days FTO except holiday and weekend. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 10:59:42 AM)
jiaju approve my leave. but i forget to talk it in today's meeting. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:00:29 AM)
should i send my FTO calendar to u and jason?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:01:50 AM)
are u online? i also want to dicuss with you about support for xen-unstable. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:15:11 AM)
yeah, sorry

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:15:34 AM)
I was saying goodnight to my son

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:15:49 AM)
yes. it is in U.S. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:15:58 AM)
should we talk tomorrow? 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:16:20 AM)
so you will be gone all next week right?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:16:30 AM)
yes. i am sorry it is late for u.

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:16:59 AM)
that doesn't give you much time to get the xen patch upstream :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:17:49 AM)
yes. i will send the patch to xen. but maybe i can not check the response in time. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:17:55 AM)
if it is trivial, might not be a problem for upstream to ACK it before you go on vacation

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:18:47 AM)
yes. it is a simple patch. just a simple lines. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:18:49 AM)
oh, I guess not

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:19:02 AM)
I forgot it is Friday for you :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:19:17 AM)
No. next day is working day. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:19:42 AM)
because of the labor day. We exchange the weekend. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:19:50 AM)
ok

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:20:06 AM)
i will work in 4.28. leave from 4.29.

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:20:16 AM)
so maybe upstream will accept it before you leave

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:20:31 AM)
i hope so. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:20:59 AM)
about support for xen-unstable. two main updates need be done for libvirt. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:23:15 AM)
1, lot of function and struct update in xen-unstable. if i directly use the "#if LIBXL_V2' in each function or struct calls. the "#if" will spread everywhere. it is a little bit ugly. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:24:53 AM)
agree

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:25:03 AM)
I need to go now

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:25:24 AM)
you can send me an email with any questions

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:25:32 AM)
OK. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:25:43 AM)
then I can think about the answers while you are gone

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:26:28 AM)
at the moment, I don't have a good solution for handling libxl_v1 vs libxl_v2

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:27:25 AM)
i understand. i will think about it, and send u email. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:28:11 AM)
one thing to remember wrt libvirt is that there are some Redhat developers in your area working on it :)

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:29:17 AM)
Osier Yang, Alex Jia, ...

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:30:11 AM)
Osier knows a lot about libvirt and probably hangs out in the #virt irc channel on oftc.net

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:30:53 AM)
I will think about the problem too

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:31:13 AM)
but for now, good night!

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:31:19 AM)
ok. i will talk with them if i needed. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:31:23 AM)
nearly lunch for you :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:31:43 AM)
yes it is. thanks your time. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:31:53 AM)
it is so late for you. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Apr 27, 2012 11:32:44 AM)
thanks your help. it is very useful for me. 

Jim Fehlig (Apr 27, 2012 11:33:01 AM)
no problem.  Bye!
