<jlopezprado_> jlopezprado
<jlopezprado_> xD
<dirk> bamvor: yes, added!
<dirk> jlopezprado_: added you as well
<jlopezprado_> thx
<bamvor> i saw it. thanks.
<bamvor> i do not fimiliar how it works. i have a Allwinner A31 STB, could i add a card about run opensuse arm on it?

<agraf> bamvor: ah, cool, would that also be built from the sunxi kernel?
<agraf> bamvor: if so, you probably just want to hook yourself into https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=devel%3AARM%3A12.3%3AContrib%3Asunxi
<bamvor> no.
<bamvor> currently, A31 code is not merge into sunxi kernel. only A10. A13. A20 in it.
<bamvor> meanwhile, i am try to port xen on A31, So a lastest kernel is more suitable for me. 
<agraf> heh ok :)
<agraf> what core is the A31?
<agraf> A7?
<bamvor> merge into sunxi 3.4 kernel is useless for me. but merge into upstream is usefull.
<bamvor> yes.
<bamvor> quad core A7.
<bamvor> it shipped with 2G memory, compare to 1G for A20. although the latter one support 2G memory. 
<agraf> ah, so KVM should work too :D
<jlopezprado_> bamvor, cubieboard is reaching 2 gb and gb lan soon
<jlopezprado_> (yellow press)
* joeyli (~joeyli@124.11.22.254) has joined #opensuse-arm
<bamvor> thanks. i know that from mailing list. 
<bamvor> if i know that earlier, maybe i will work on port xen to A20, which should easier than A31 because so many people working on A20. 
<bamvor> to jlopezprado: u mean cubietruck, right?
* gavinguo (~gavin@114-42-77-95.dynamic.hinet.net) has joined #opensuse-arm
<agraf> bamvor: so why xen?
<bamvor> yes. and a linaro also said that it might be easier port kvm then port xen. 
<agraf> oh, I'm pretty sure it is ;)
<bamvor> it just i use xen more than kvm in my works. 
<bamvor> and also because of it, i trying to port lastest kernel to A31 at the same time, then i could try kvm. 
<agraf> ah, ok :)
<agraf> bamvor: I've started to package Xen for ARM, still need to actually sr it to the virtualization repo
<bamvor> agraf: i just need add cortex-a7 in kvm_target_cpu in kernel? that it? 
<bamvor> agraf: do i need do something in qemu for A31?
<agraf> bamvor: there were reports of people who already used kvm on a7
<agraf> bamvor: I'm not sure how much work there really is necessary to get it going
<agraf> bamvor: but I'm sure someone in #kvm-arm can tell you :)
<agraf> bamvor: it can't be that hard
<bamvor> ok. thanks.
<agraf> bamvor: I think it basically "just works", but isn't 100% architecturally correct
<agraf> bamvor: as some of the stack thinks it's running an A15, while it really is an A7
<agraf> bamvor: there were a few discussions, but I know too little of the deep-down differences between A7 and A15
<bamvor> agraf: yes, i understand. only some coprocessor register is difference between a7 and a15. 
<agraf> bamvor: but I think most A7 work happened on big-little which is obviously a lot more difficult
<bamvor> agraf: thanks u infomation. i will investigate these. 
<agraf> bamvor: but really, I happily invite you to join #kvm-arm
<agraf> bamvor: lots of friendly people there, happy to help out usually :)
<bamvor> thanks. i join it right now. 
<awafaa> i'd be curious about kvm on an a7, speaking to maz there was some code needed still
<agraf> awafaa: yeah, I'll try to get marc and bamvor to talk to each other :)
<agraf> awafaa: is maz at his desk? he doesn't seem to reply
<awafaa> he's french what do you expect?!
<awafaa> agraf: let me go and poke him, physically
<agraf> awafaa: thanks a lot ;)
<bamvor> awafaa and agraf; thanks both of u. 
<awafaa> OK looks like he's hiding. I'll poke him when he's back
<bamvor> awafaa: thanks. it is almost 10pm in my timezone. i am going to home right now. hope i could catch him tomorrow. 
<awafaa> bamvor: no problem, I'll tell him to look out for you in #kvm-arm
<bamvor> awafaa: thanks your help.
