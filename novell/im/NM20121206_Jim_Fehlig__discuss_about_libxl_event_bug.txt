Hi

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 11:50:06 AM)
hi.

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 11:50:34 AM)
are you headed out to lunch?  do you have a few minutes?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 11:51:05 AM)
i have a few minutes. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 11:52:38 AM)
have you looked at Ian J's mail?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 11:52:43 AM)
yes. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 11:53:23 AM)
i read it yestoday. but i am got his idea. unfornately, i do not know how to start to ask him. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 11:53:24 AM)
I did a build with his patch, but haven't tried it yet

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 11:55:22 AM)
I'm surprised I didn't get compiler warnings since the patch uses 'register' as a param to a macro

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:01:39 PM)
Did you see Ian C's response?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:01:51 PM)
yes. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:02:33 PM)
but there is a eventlock in libvirt. this is part of reason  why this race condition occurred i guess.

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:04:16 PM)
Ian C's first suggestion is already implemented in libvirt's event loop afaict

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:04:34 PM)
yes. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:05:11 PM)
libvirt holds eventLoop.lock during callback processing and register/deregister

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:05:14 PM)
this race condition will occurred just after libvirt release its event lock. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:05:35 PM)
before calling callback. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:07:03 PM)
i was think about that do not release libvirt event lock during calling callback. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:07:36 PM)
but it will effect all the hypersor unless add a flag in libvirt. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:08:45 PM)
normal process: release lock-> cb -> got lock. 
libxl process: do not release lock during cb. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:08:50 PM)
I don't think changing the libvirt event code will be possible

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:10:02 PM)
yes. i think so. so, i do not know how to fix this bug in a simply way. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:10:43 PM)
meanwhile, i am reading libvirt qemu driver. it is more complex than libxl driver in the event handling function. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:11:09 PM)
yes

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:12:05 PM)
it seems that qemu do a lots of check before actual call the qemu monitor commands. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:12:28 PM)
and the locking mechanisms in the driver add to the complexity

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:12:50 PM)
we'll have that eventually too :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:13:20 PM)
sorry. do you mean qemu monitor lock? 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:13:25 PM)
but not as many locks, e.g. no monitor lock

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:13:33 PM)
yes

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:15:01 PM)
I think the monitor lock is held while waiting for a response, via the event loop of course

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:17:18 PM)
yes. i think so too. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:41:43 PM)
how about the "one serious problem remaining" mention by Ian J. i think it will not happen. because the different regisration should have the different ev(libxl__ev_fd, libxl__ev_time). 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:43:28 PM)
hello? 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:47:11 PM)
sorry, was away for a bit

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:48:12 PM)
it is ok. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:48:26 PM)
yeah, I think you are right

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:48:52 PM)
but I haven't looked at the libxl code closely

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:49:46 PM)
i have check some of, but not all of. registration function, it is different ev. maybe i should check all the registration before i rely to Ian Jackson. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:49:48 PM)
IMO, you could respond to Ian with such a comment

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:50:33 PM)
yeah. it is several days after Ian jaskson comments. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:51:49 PM)
yeah, and we need to get this resolved anyhow :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:53:06 PM)
yeah. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:53:15 PM)
I'll push another version of the libxl conversion patch this week too

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:53:24 PM)
probably on Friday

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 12:53:32 PM)
what changes? 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:53:43 PM)
nothing much

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:54:04 PM)
more to make some noise

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:54:18 PM)
I'd like to get it committed for 1.0.1

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 12:55:37 PM)
I think there will be a freeze for 1.0.1 on Mon or Tue

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 1:04:29 PM)
ok. i write a script for testing libxl. but not finish. i will test your patch v2. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 1:10:09 PM)
cool, thanks

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 1:10:42 PM)
See if you can cook up some response to Ian J.

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 1:11:02 PM)
I too will think about it some more

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 1:11:59 PM)
I wanted to spend some time today looking at this problem, but arrived in the morning to a cloud bug that needed my attention

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 1:12:31 PM)
hopefully I wont have such distractions the next two days

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 1:13:01 PM)
SP3 alpha2 checkin is on Friday

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 1:13:40 PM)
ok. i will try to reply to Ian J and Ian C today. thanks. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 1:13:43 PM)
I'm going to call it a day now

Jim Fehlig (Dec 6, 2012 1:13:54 PM)
talk to you tomorrow

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 6, 2012 1:14:25 PM)
ok. see you tomorrow.
