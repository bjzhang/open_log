hello

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:35:07)
hi

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:39:14)
yestoday, i test with Ian Jackson patch v3 and your lastest patch. the old problem in libxl has been fixed after several test.. but i got assertion error after pthread mutex lock successful, the assertion should be araise while mutex lock fail. i do not why it happens. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:40:41)
yes, I'm getting that assertion now too

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:41:20)
I was testing a new version of my patch and saw the assertion

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:41:51)
I've went back to a previous version of my patch and still see the assertion

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:42:36)
strange because I don't remember seeing the assertion during my testing yesterday

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:43:37)
yes. it is wired. in my test, even "virsh list" may be encounter this assertion. and from my point of view, the assertion should not happern. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:45:34)
i test these patch base on upstream xen and libvirt. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:48:46)
do you know what the error code is from pthread_mutex_lock?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:49:07)
0

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:49:17)
sorry. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:49:19)
r = 0.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:49:24)
i do not check errno

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:49:36)
i got r from gdb. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:49:51)
how is !0 not true? :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:50:11)
yes. unless gdb tell me wrong. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:51:08)
i got r after assertion fail. then i go back the pthread mutex lock parent function with frame command. then print r. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:51:53)
maybe i should check errno. or print r and error. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:53:00)
yep, I see the same in gdb

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:56:30)
where could i find a openID?

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:58:27)
you create one - http://openid.net/

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:58:47)
but you shouldn't need to login to use that paste

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 8:59:24)
oh. ok. 

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 8:59:26)

the first error the same as u. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 9:01:21)
but the second error is different. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 9:01:51)
because the ctx point is invalid in the second error.

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 9:12:25)
btw, here is the latest libvirt patch I am testing - http://paste.opensuse.org/15212799

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 9:12:25)
do you see anything obviously wrong with it?

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 9:12:25)
or with the one you are testing for that matter

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 9:12:25)
seems this is another bug in libxl

Jim Fehlig (2012-12-14 9:12:25)
the libvirt side seems to be correct with my latest patch

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 9:17:35)
i could test it when i arrive  at company. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 9:17:45)
i still at home. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 9:18:09)
will u online after 20 miniutes? 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2012-12-14 9:18:22)
i have some other questions.

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:19:30 AM)
there is some memory mis-management issue in his patches...

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:20:23 AM)
I'm wondering if the whole race wasn't caused by the libvirt libxl driver in the first place

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:21:08 AM)
by not removing the timeout in libxlTimerCallback(), before calling libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout()

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:23:06 AM)
what do you think?
 Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:23:42 AM)
sorry, do u mean move  LIBXL_TAILQ_REMOVE(&CTX->etimes, ev, entry); after ev->func(egc, ev, &ev->abs); in libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout?

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:26:37 AM)
no, I mean in the libvirt libxl driver's libxlTimerCallback() function.  E.g. this change removes the timeout before calling libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout():
 static void libxlTimerCallback(int timer ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED, void *timer_v)
 {
     struct libxlOSEventHookTimerInfo *timer_info = timer_v;
+    libxlDomainObjPrivatePtr priv = timer_info->priv;
+    void *xl_priv = timer_info->xl_priv;
 
-    libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout(timer_info->priv->ctx, timer_info->xl_priv);
+    /* libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout expects the timeout to be
+       deregisterd. */
+    if (virEventRemoveTimeout(timer_info->id) == 0)
+        libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout(priv->ctx, xl_priv);


Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:27:35 AM)
but that is not the case since afaict the timer never fires anyhow, so the callback isn't invoked

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:28:27 AM)
without Ian's patches, libxl will register the timer and then call deregister before the timer even fires

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:41:37 AM)
I forced  the timer to fire and got a segfault in libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout()

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:42:48 AM)
btw, with Ian's patches, I noticed that pthread_mutex_lock is returning 22 when we hit the assertion

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:42:55 AM)
22 = EINVAL

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:43:39 AM)
so as you said before, the ctx is getting corrupted

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:43:58 AM)
sometimes we hit the assert, sometimes it can segfault

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:44:07 AM)
yes. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:44:33 AM)
what else did you have to talk about?

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:44:51 AM)
I don't know how much longer I will work

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:44:57 AM)
a small question about LIBXL_SAVE_HELPER

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:46:57 AM)
when libxl call save function, libxl_save_helper will called through LIBXL_SAVE_HELPER or LIBEXEC:
getenv("LIBXL_SAVE_HELPER") ?: LIBEXEC "/" "libxl-save-helper";


Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:47:19 AM)
when i build xen4.3 on build service, LIBEXEC is /usr/lib/xen/bin. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:47:28 AM)
but it should be /usr/lib64/xen/bin

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:47:38 AM)
i do know why it is wrong. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:48:50 AM)
it is ok for my test. because i could set LIBXL_SAVE_HELPER env. but LIBEXEC should be right. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:50:39 AM)
i do not where the LIBEXEC set. if i know maybe  i could know where is wrong. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:56:41 AM)
it's in tools/libxl/_paths.h

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:57:54 AM)
I explicitly specify libexecdir in the libvirt spec file

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:58:24 AM)
see the '--libexecdir=%{_libdir}/%{name}' option to configure in libvirt.spec

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 10:58:56 AM)
%{libdir} expands to /usr/lib or /usr/lib64 as appropriate

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:59:15 AM)
it was think that it should be set automatically. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:59:38 AM)
why it is set to lib or lib64 in my x86_64 build? 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 10:59:56 AM)
ok. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:00:06 AM)
i will set it in configure. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:00:25 AM)
I'm not sure if that works for libxl

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:00:45 AM)
I mean it is hardcoded in  tools/libxl/_paths.h

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:01:19 AM)
" tools/libxl/_paths.h" is not exist in xen upstream?


Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:03:38 AM)
ah, I see that

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:03:45 AM)
I was looking in xen4.2

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:05:26 AM)
sorry it is exist.

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:05:38 AM)
ok, so in xen-unstable LIBEXEC is defined in config/StdGNU.mk

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:07:03 AM)
LIBEXEC = $(PREFIX)/lib/xen/bin


Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:07:22 AM)
so, it is a bug? should be a check?

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:08:23 AM)
I'm not sure

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:08:23 AM)
check lib64 or lib?

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:08:58 AM)
I don't recall the rules around libexecdir

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:09:09 AM)
because in my x86_64, /usr/lib64/xen/bin have more file than /usr/lib/xen/bin. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:10:22 AM)
but notice some of the stuff in /usr/lib64/xen/bin is linked to /usr/lib/xen/bin

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:10:44 AM)
maybe we need a link for libxl-save-helper

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:11:08 AM)
that would be a tweak to xen.spec

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:12:53 AM)
libxl-save-helper is in the /usr/lib64/xen/bin. why we need  a link? 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:14:16 AM)
if libexec is not /usr/lib64 in xen. lots of cmd will not work .

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:21:59 AM)
you should ask upstream

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:22:06 AM)
ok. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:22:14 AM)
I'm not sure if this is deliberate or not

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:22:45 AM)
my question is why libxl_save_helper is installed in /usr/lib64/xen/bin. but run_helper search it in the /usr/lib/xen/bin. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:22:46 AM)
recall that xen runs on non-linux platforms

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:22:55 AM)
so maybe something to do with that

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:27:11 AM)
ah, now I understand after you rephrased your question

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:27:26 AM)
in tools/libxl/Makefile:
$(INSTALL_PROG) libxl-save-helper $(DESTDIR)$(PRIVATE_BINDIR)

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:28:09 AM)
where PRIVATE_BINDIR = $(PRIVATE_PREFIX)/bin

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:28:18 AM)
and PRIVATE_PREFIX = $(LIBDIR)/xen

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:28:46 AM)
so PRIVATE_BINDIR = /usr/lib64/xen/bin/

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:29:14 AM)
yes, seems like a bug upstream

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:29:52 AM)
as you say, run_helper should look in the same dir

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:30:18 AM)
you should cook up a patch and send it to xen-devel...

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:30:53 AM)
ok. thanks. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:30:58 AM)
i will work on it. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:32:16 AM)
thanks your help. it is too late for u. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:37:17 AM)
we really need to analyze and fix the assertion/segfault we're seeing in libxl

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:37:43 AM)
let me know if you make any progress on that today

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:38:19 AM)
ok. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:38:22 AM)
did you have any other question?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:41:35 AM)
when i build xen upstream, i got error in xc_domain.c. about xc_dom_trace error. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:42:31 AM)
i guess a bug in xen code. but i am not sure. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:42:37 AM)
it is not hurry. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:45:10 AM)
Ok, maybe I'll take a look at that tomorrow

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:45:21 AM)
I need to be testing on xen-unstable anyhow

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:45:44 AM)
so I'll probably see the same thing when trying to build it

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:46:28 AM)
ok. i will focus on assertion/segfault today. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:46:47 AM)
yes, please do

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:47:24 AM)
hopefully you will find something by the time I wake up tomorrow :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:47:25 AM)
i build xen-unstable on build service and test in these days. but i remove almost all the patch in xen.spec. unless the build is fail. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:47:52 AM)
ok. i will try. and if i got something, email to u. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:49:37 AM)
yes, I usually just checkout xen-unstable and then do 'make xen; make tools;  make install-xen; make install-tools'

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:50:22 AM)
you can do 'make help' to see the options xen's makefile supports

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:51:17 AM)
ok. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:51:46 AM)
I remove our xen packages before doing make install

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:52:29 AM)
just to ensure there is nothing from our packages that might interfere with xen upstream

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:53:06 AM)
but it has been a little while since I've ran xen-unstable

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:53:21 AM)
useful. i could try it to.

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:53:24 AM)
there might be some things I'm missing

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:54:19 AM)
or new things that need to be done to account for upstream changes

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:55:27 AM)
you'll need all the BuildRequires from xen.spec installed on the machine where you will build xen-unstable

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:56:26 AM)
the buildrequire is not changed from xen4.2 to xen-unstable in my build. and it is build successful. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:56:45 AM)
but pv vm boot seems fail. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:57:41 AM)
pv vm boot got nothing in libvirt. but is right in xl. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:58:29 AM)
seems there are lots of issues

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:58:57 AM)
i could list it today and email to u. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:59:36 AM)
ok, I'm going to call it a day

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:59:57 AM)
it is getting late here

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 12:00:09 PM)
and I'm tired of working for the day :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 12:00:48 PM)
ok. sorry for so late for u. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 12:00:52 PM)

Hi

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:01:50 PM)
after apply the patch u give me morning. assertion/seqfault is not occurred. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:01:57 PM)
but i got hang. while testing. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:02:08 PM)
in save or even in virsh list. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:03:13 PM)
in the save, it is hang just after libxl_save_helper success, according to the libxl.log: 
libxl-save-helper: debug: complete r=0: Success

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:03:45 PM)
but after some debug, i still do not know why it happens. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:04:05 PM)
hmm, ok

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:04:17 PM)
so which patch of mine are you using?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:04:43 PM)
in the suse paste

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:04:43 PM)

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:06:04 PM)
ok, the very latest one that I was planning to send upstream once we have all these issues worked out

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:06:41 PM)
btw, did you make any changes to Ian J's patch?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:07:46 PM)
nope. i am lost. sorry.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:08:26 PM)
meanwhile, even if save successful, there is a tap destroy error: 
libxl: error: libxl_blktap2.c:80:libxl__device_destroy_tapdisk: Failed to destroy tap device id 7065 minor 0: Input/output error


Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:09:04 PM)
i am not sure whether it is relative to hang or save fail after a successful save and restore. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:09:55 PM)
BTW, i  got error while exit virt-viewer, it should not relative to our issue, so, i just ignore it: 
2012-12-14 12:58:45.909+0000: 4222: error : virNetSocketReadWire:1293 : End of file while reading data: Input/output error

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:11:55 PM)
yeah, maybe the tap destroy issue is causing the hang

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:12:12 PM)
but that would account for a hang on listing domains

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:14:11 PM)
have you made that change locally or are you just using his patch as is?

without the change I mention, the modify callback does not get the right timer id

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:18:56 PM)
do you see messages like "virEventModifyTimeout: ignoring invalid timer 0"?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:19:07 PM)
yes. 

Jim Fehlig (Dec 14, 2012 11:19:46 PM)
those go away if you make the &ev->nexus->for_app_re change to Ian's patch :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Dec 14, 2012 11:57:46 PM)
