Hi

hi

I stumbled across another issue today with the libxl driver on xen-unstable

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 1:53:04 PM)
when doing a save, the event handler was being called with shutdown_reason == SUSPEND

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 1:53:12 PM)
that would cause the driver to deadlock

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 1:53:56 PM)
other than that, I haven't seen any other problems

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 1:54:21 PM)
I don't see that issue when running xen 4.2.1 - odd

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 1:57:15 PM)
I'll update patch 5 (of the 6 I posted to the list Monday) and send a new version

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 1:57:31 PM)
but that will have to wait until tomorrow

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 1:57:36 PM)
I'm going to call it a day

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 1:58:09 PM)
ok.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 1:58:34 PM)
i test on xen4.2.1 is ok too. with ian j and your patches. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 1:58:46 PM)
but i got the different error on xen-unstable.

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 1:59:30 PM)
hmm, could it be related to what I described above?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 2:00:04 PM)
nope. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 2:01:48 PM)
it is assertion fail on pv create or segment fault on hvm create. i doubt that it maybe because of some environment problem. so i will try it again on a fresh system. 

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:02:13 PM)
ok

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:02:40 PM)
if you do a save with xen-unstable, don't be surprised to see libvirtd deadlock :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 2:04:19 PM)
BYW, i re-think the race condition i found when u in Beijing. i am not suse the whether it is a race or not. i mean maybe it is just because libxl finish the fd tranfer a little bit early. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 2:04:39 PM)
i fogot how ian reply to my doubt at that time:(

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:05:43 PM)
there are still other races though

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:06:14 PM)
I've found others beyond what you found when I was in Beijing

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 2:07:02 PM)
yes. i understand. i just want to know whether the race should happen.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 2:07:24 PM)
maybe it is because i do not get the point. 

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:07:56 PM)
yeah, maybe the race you found wouldn't happen with the improvements to the libxl driver I've made

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:08:42 PM)
If you notice, we now hold a lock in all the libxl upcalls and callback from libvirt event loop

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 2:08:58 PM)
yes. 

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:09:48 PM)
that way, an fd deregister upcall from libxl wont rip everything out from under use while we're executing the fd callback from libvirt event loop

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:10:21 PM)
same for timeouts

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 2:12:36 PM)
ok. i remember it. i have read your code. i want to re-think the whole story, before u finish it. it is useful for me. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Jan 24, 2013 2:12:38 PM)
thanks

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:13:01 PM)
ok, sound good

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:13:13 PM)
I'm going to bed now

Jim Fehlig (Jan 24, 2013 2:13:31 PM)
talk to you tomorrow on the bi-weekly call :)
