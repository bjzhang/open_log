hi

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:11:07 PM)
are u debuging the migration? 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:16:02 PM)
yes

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:17:33 PM)
do u make some progress?  or find some clue? 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:18:46 PM)
is that work on your test machine? 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:20:30 PM)
I am not clear about the lock added into migration, so just debug part by part, first without lock, then add lock.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:23:14 PM)
in my test, migration is not work even not including the lock. it is sucessful from A to B, but fail on B to A. I suspect that maybe it is because the different environment(it is the sles11 sp2 on vmware). 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:25:39 PM)
in my previous test, there is also that problem. live migration succeeds from A to B, but fails from B to A ( the log shows that libxl domain_suspend fails)

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:26:48 PM)
But I guess it's not the libvirt problem. I used to think it's due to the specific machine.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:27:03 PM)
i got this error: xc: error: error setting the HVM context (1 = Operation not permitted): Internal error

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:27:13 PM)
maybe it is not the same error? 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:28:05 PM)
not the same.

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:28:41 PM)
But in my memory, when I did live migration and at the same time did 'virsh list', I got that error.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:30:47 PM)
yes, it shoud be fail if no extra lock added(e.g. my lock patch). 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:32:05 PM)
do u add libxl driver lock in MigratePerform3? if not, migration will fail whle virsh list execute. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:32:47 PM)
so, what's your plan? 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:35:55 PM)
first, read the changes you have made.  (ended). second, merge the changes which I can understand (except lock part) and test. (in process and should be ended soon.) third, if that doesn't work, add the lock into it and test. (will do)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:38:20 PM)
greate. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:39:45 PM)
i puzzled about  that whether the lock patch is affected the migration function or ott. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:41:03 PM)
if there is some wrong in lock patch, migration should be good(except the virsh list or other command while migration). but my test do not support this. 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:41:45 PM)
I haven't read your lock patch yet, so not clear how it works. :) So let's just test part by part, if the lock part needed, maybe I should read the lock patch too. :)

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:42:06 PM)
it looks like the lock patch lead to the situation worse.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:42:17 PM)
yes. it is what i am doing. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:42:53 PM)
i am testing migration without lock these days. 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:43:31 PM)
really? How about the result.

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:43:33 PM)
?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:44:57 PM)
it is sucessful from A to B, but fail on B to A. I suspect that maybe it is because the different environment(it is the sles11 sp2 on vmware).  i got this error: xc: error: error setting the HVM context (1 = Operation not permitted): Internal error

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:46:12 PM)
I have another two physical machines which can be used to test.

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:46:32 PM)
207.46 and 207.155

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:47:14 PM)
207.155 (AMD) 207.46 (Intel) both install sles11 sp2

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:47:27 PM)
ok.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:47:54 PM)
where do you find so many machines? 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:47:57 PM)
Ma Lin helped us to prepare that yesterday. But now I still test on your machine.

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:48:32 PM)
We have two test machines in the lab. (number 9, 10)

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:48:53 PM)
9 is 207.46, 10 is used by Bo Yang.

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:49:19 PM)
And I have a destop machine which is also put in lab ( number 11), that's 207.151

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:50:08 PM)
Actually I still have a mobile Dell D630, Ma Lin uses it.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:50:59 PM)
so, i have 4 test machine?

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:51:32 PM)
Yes, we can use those machines for test.

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:52:45 PM)
D630 has some problem after installing sles11 sp2 (latest version). Xen kernel cannot be started. It's on Ma Lin's desktop. Nobody uses it now.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:54:21 PM)
great. besides, i have an i3 destop with sles11 sp2. 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:55:17 PM)
That's great, so we can also test on physical machines. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:57:57 PM)
yes. i will test on physical machines. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:58:15 PM)
i use 207.46 and 207.155? 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:58:34 PM)
46, 151

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:58:45 PM)
oh, no 155

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 4:58:55 PM)
you are right, 46 and 155

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 4:59:33 PM)
ok. 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 5:00:16 PM)
How about your lock patch, it's finished?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:02:44 PM)
i thought it is ok for send to upstream. So, i send to Jim lastest week(and send to you). Jim said he will test it. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:04:21 PM)
i am not meet him on im. i do not know whether it is ok for him. 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 5:05:33 PM)
Good news! I think he may send feed back later. Seems he is very busy these days.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:05:51 PM)
yes. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:06:12 PM)
beside. a u build the libvirt on obs?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:07:44 PM)
beside. a u build the libvirt on obs? 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:07:53 PM)
i could not build it successful.

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 5:08:22 PM)
no, I just build it on local machine.

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 5:08:55 PM)
But there is an error after I checkin the latest libvirt, there is a Wlogical-op error.

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 5:09:36 PM)
I change the "configure" file and disable "-Wlogical-op" to make it pass.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:09:55 PM)
rpmbuild? 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 5:10:22 PM)
no, just make and make install and start libvirtd manually.

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 5:11:27 PM)
But I can check ibs later, which branch do you use?

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:11:35 PM)
yes. it is not convenience for test on different machine. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:11:41 PM)
https://build.suse.de/package/show?package=libvirt&project=Devel%3AVirt%3ASLE-11-SP3

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:12:02 PM)
it looks like jim had build libvirt 0.10 succesful on sp2. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:12:09 PM)
maybe i could use this one. 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 5:13:52 PM)
yes, we can try. Just update the libvirt package to new version.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:14:13 PM)
it is almost the laster version. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:14:23 PM)
0.10.0 is the laster release. 

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:14:36 PM)
so, it is not difficult i guess. 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 5:15:52 PM)
Yes. Jim's build also on ibs? sles11sp2 update still uses 0.9.6

Bamvor Jian Zhang (Sep 18, 2012 5:16:42 PM)
yes. looks like for sp3. but it is ok for us. because he only test on sp2. 

Chun Yan Liu (Sep 18, 2012 5:17:30 PM)
then we can use it.
