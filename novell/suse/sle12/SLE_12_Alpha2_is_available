Hi,

We are happy to announce SLE 12 Alpha 2, which was a little bit reluctant to
become alive.


We offer 3 DVD ISOs: DVD1 contains the binaries, the second
DVD the sources and the third DVD the debuginfo packages. 
The final product will not contain the debuginfo packages on the media.


You can get the iso images from:

  http://download.suse.de/install/SLE-12-Server-Alpha2/
  http://download.suse.de/install/SLE-12-Desktop-Alpha2/
  http://download.suse.de/install/SLE-12-HA-Alpha2/
  http://download.suse.de/install/SLE-12-Server-VMware-Alpha2/

Known problems (may not apply to every product):

 - SLES s390x images are only installable and bootable with high soffisticated
   magic.
   We are considering an inter-alpha release if we get fixes for that soon.
 - Libreoffice is not installable atm
 - SLED: aNetworkManager not enabled by default
 - Registration not working (just click 'next' on the SCC screen)
 - installation workflow for SLES not final
 - SLES doesn't use gnome-classic mode yet
   Workaround: install gnome-shell-classic and set the windowmanager in
   /etc/sysconfig/windowmanager from "gnome" to "gnome-classic"


The milestones for this release were:
  o Milestone: Code freeze for toolchain (GCC, glibc, binutils, rpm)
  o Milestone: Code freeze for Installer (yast core, yast installation,
    sysconfig, udev, hal, dbus, libzypp, systemd)
  o Milestone: Code coming from partners has been integrated, feedback has been
    given to the partners regarding the submitted code
  o Kernel and installer work on a limited range of machines.
  o Bootable ISO with kernel, installer and all toolchain packages updated.
  o Internal snapshot only, not released outside of SUSE


Next steps:

The split-off from Factory is nearly finished. Stay tuned for more information
coming on Friday 17th.

Alpha 3 submission deadline is 

for ALL packages or packages:
        Friday January 24th, 15:00 CET


Happy testing!
