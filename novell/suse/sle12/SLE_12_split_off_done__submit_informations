Hi everybody,

we have finished (after some delays) the split off of SLE 12 from
openSUSE:Factory. This means, submissions to openSUSE:Factory will no longer
end up automatically in SLE 12.

Submissions for SLE 12  products should now go to

   		SUSE:SLE-12:GA

in the IBS. Images are build regularly, even in-between milestones, and can be
found at
	/mounts/dist/install/SLE-UNTESTED/ 
.

Submissions to openSUSE:Factory that have not been accepted in the last two
days may not be in the current SLE 12 codebase, too. We kindly ask you to check
if all your submissions that are needed for SLE 12 are in the new repository.

To make life easier for everybody (submitter, reviewer, approver, QA,
Maintenance, NTS, and, last but not least, customers and users) we would like
to give you an overview over rules and guidelines for submit requests.
As a general guideline: If you follow the openSUSE guidelines, you should be
mostly fine.

For those who only want the short stuff, read the next section. Afterwards, a
longer section with some explanations and reasons is added. (Skip simply to
"DETAILED SECTION"). We recommend to read it.

================
 - Keep in mind: The reviewers and approvers are humans.
 - Submissions to SLE 12 should be tested before they get submitted. Really.
 - Submit early, not in the last minute.
 - Every submission requires an incremental changelog entry.
 - Keep upstream (incl. openSUSE:Factory) up-to-date.
 - Changelog entries:
   * Bugzilla numbers
   * Fate numbers
   * Patch information
 - Verify dependencies
 - Inform release managers about new packages

================
HERE STARTS THE DETAILED SECTION:
================

 - Keep in mind: The reviewers and approvers are humans.
   There are currently around 2300 source packages in SLE 12, and you as
   submitter are more familiar with your packages than we are. If you think a
   reject reason is wrong because of lack of understanding, speak to us. Don't
   scream , or call us names. That's not helping ;)
   Check-ins are done by a team of Release Managers and BuildService Team
   Members, so there's a broad knowledge, but of course there are gaps.
 
 - Submissions to SLE 12 should be tested before they get submitted. Really.
   "Testing" means:
   * Verify that the submit has all sources, and references them in the .spec
     file
   * Test if the package builds.
   * Test if the software runs.

 - Submit early, not in the last minute. We are checking in as often as
   possible, and build constantly images that can be used for testing and
   verification. An early submission helps us in that regard, and allows us to
   find build- and dependency issues that you may not be aware of early, saving
   you some urgent "we need this fixed now" requests from the Release Managers ;)
   Keep in mind that _all_ submissions to SLE 12 get pushed through the legal
   review queue, delays are to be expected. So last minute submissions may miss
   a deadline due to that.

 - Every submission requires an incremental changelog entry.
   The SR logmessage can be empty, but the changelog must have a (non-empty) entry.
   If you have information that helps the reviewers to make a decision, but
   that are not fit for the changelog (e.g. "this package should best be
   checked in together with package foo"), it is highly appreciated if you add
   them to the osc log message. It helps the reviewers, and can spare you of
   questions coming otherwise.
 
 - Keep upstream (incl. openSUSE:Factory) up-to-date.
   A submission to SUSE:SLE-12:GA should also be submitted to openSUSE:Factory
   if possible. Reasons not to do so would be that the package is only for SLE
   intended and never will be part of an openSUSE release, legal constraints,
   or derivates in the version requirements (exapmle: The Kernel for SLE will
   be 3.12, openSUSE will have something newer).
   It speeds up the acceptance if your package submission also has an
   equivalent submit request to openSUSE:Factory running.

 - Changelog entries:
   The changelogs are read by a wide range of people, varying from internal
   developers with high insight into the package up to partners with no clue
   about technical details.
   A changelog entry should give a good insight of why the package was changed,
   and what the effects are.
   This means: add a bugzilla number and/or a FATE number whenever it exists.
   You can submit stuff without an existing bugnumber, but the documentation
   in the changelog should then be according to the intrusiveness of the
   change, means: Explain bigger/intrusive changes in a good way, for small
   fixes ('typo in the description') a simple remark is enough ("typos fixed").
   If the change results in a behavioral change, mention this and the effects
   in the changelog!

   Mentioning of patches added and removed:
   We are aware of the complaints this caused with the submissions to
   openSUSE:Factory. While a better source control system in obs would be
   helpful, we don't have it currently. Mentioning patches that got
   removed/added in the changelog entry helps Maintenance and others when they
   have to look at a package several months after the change was submitted.
   osc helps you to add this information, so we kindly ask you to add it for SLE, too.
   (That way, it's also easier for you to submit the package to openSUSE:Factory, too)
   We deviate here from openSUSE:Factory insofar as we are more relaxed when it
   comes to initial submissions (no need to add all patches there), and if you
   just change all names due to a version upgrade a one-line sentence stating
   it is enough. You can of course add the full information anyway.

 - Verify dependencies
   If the dependency list for your submitted package changes, make sure that
   the newly required stuff is already on the product the package is intended
   for. The fact that a package exists in SUSE:SLE-12:GA does NOT mean that it
   is on all products! For verification, you can check the latest build.
   Be aware that a newly added package on SLES needs to be L3 supported by the
   maintainer. 

 - Inform release managers about new packages
   The package lists for the media of the products are manually changed.
   Packages need to be added explicitely. So, if you want to have a package on
   the media, let the Release Manager of the corresponding product know.
   It helps if you have a FATE-request, and write a line like this
   <p>Packages: dracut-caps, dracut-network, dracut-tools, dracut</p>
   into the "misc"/"References" field of the FATE (example taken from FATE 316475).
   It's not a requirement, but this information helps us as we have scripts
   informing us about this, and you don't need to send us an email.
