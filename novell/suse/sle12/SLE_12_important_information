[devel] SLE 12 important information

Hi all,

a few informations that may help you:

%suse_version in  SLE12:
  Here's an overview for this macro:
  SLE 12 GA:	    1315
  openSUSE_13.1:    1310
  openSUSE Factory: 1320

  Be are aware that the %suse_version in SLE 12 Ga is currently set wrongly to
  1320, this will be fixed over the weekend. If you have spec files relying on
  it, adapt them.
  We are sorry for the inconvenience.

%sles_version in SLE12:
  There's no %sles_version in the IBS.


We also recommend to use the latest Build that we have created since Alpha3 for
the SLE 12 products. Hundreds of bugs have been fixed, and a lot of adaptions
done.
Especially if you have issues with Yast2 or systemd, we recommend those.
You can find them (for all products) at
	/mounts/dist/ibs/SUSE:/SLE-12:/GA/images/iso
respective
	http://dist.suse.de/ibs//SUSE:/SLE-12:/GA/images/iso/


Using those images helps us to avoid duplicates, and spares you some time
struggeling with bugs :)



The legal review queue is currently in good shape, so now is a good time to
submit your packages and get them fast processed. Don't wait until the last
minute wrt. Beta1, thanks.

Btw, if you have questions with regard to rejected submit requests, either ask
Legal (Ciaran) in case it got rejected by the legal team, or the Release
Managers of SLE 12. Rudi and the other Autobuild team members are not the right
contacts.

	thanks,
	  Your Enterprise Release Team
