[edit]Basic Knowledges of Kernel

[edit]Topic [1]: Basic knowledges of Kernel

  Category:

  Some parts of kernel we are interested:
  1. Networking(IPSEC)
  2. mm(especially buddy algrithm & slab)
  3. RCU(the kernel locking mechanism)
  4. block I/O

  Reason || Description:
  As L3 team has always to resolve kernel relative bugs reported from customer, so this kind of training would be really interesting to us.

  Desired effect:
  We can have the basic knowledges of those parts, and hope it could help us to locate the cause of bugs.
[edit]Topic [2]: memory management and test tools

  Summary: memory management and test tools

  Category: mm

  Reason || Description:
  When testing the performance decline occurs,sometimes we can't provide the info which are excepted by developers.
  So if we can learn more about memory management of OS,we can contribution more

  Desired Effect:
  Deeply analyze performance of OS, providing better information to developers 
[edit]Topic [3]: the schedule strategies of processes and IO tasks

  Summary: the schedule strategies of processes and IO tasks.

  Category: Process Scheduling, IO

  Reason|| Description:
  I believe that the workload of a kernel is managment of IO and processes.
  And these are also the software factors determining the performence of a system.

  Desired Effect:
  Give a comprehensive description of the core ideas of scheduling in the current kernel.
  Or comparing some different strategies of scheduling with the pros and cons. 
[edit]Topic [4]: new technology introduction

   what is new in kernel and what will be in kernel
[edit]File systems

[edit]Topic [1]: The read/write mechanisms of File System

  Summary: The read/write mechanisms of File System

  Category: FS

  Reason|| Description:
  We always talking about the fs I/O performance, But most of us have no idea what impact the performance a lot, especially in difference FS type.

  Desired Effect:
  Understanding the mechanisms of FS read/write and also the structure, may help us to analyze the FS performance
[edit]Topic [2]: btrfs

  Reason: will be used in future distribution and solve problem on it
 
  Desired Effect: difference between btrfs and ext4, how its new technology is implemented.
[edit]Device

[edit]Topic [1]: What's the fundamental thing of block device driver

  Introduction to linux kernel block device driver, especially RAID and volume manager, like md
  Summary: What's the fundamental thing of block device driver

  Category:[device]

  Reason || Description:
  There's new feature related to it. We want to know more about this field.

  Desired Effect:
  To better understand block device driver, especially md
[edit]Topic [2]: Block device

  Reason: to debug block device related bugs in virtualization work

  Desired Effect:
  * detail about the block device driver model, like, how to probe and generate a device, and how IO is handled, and how udev plays role in it.
  * training about direct IO technology (vt-d)
[edit]Networking

[edit]Topic [1]: Introduction to linux kernel networking stack

  Introduction to linux kernel networking stack
  Summary: How's the lifecycle of a packet when it go through linux kernel networking stack.

  Category:[networking]

  Reason || Description:
  There's always a connection between network and security. I want to know more about this field.

  Desired Effect:
  To better understand the how networking stack is implemented in linux kernel.
[edit]Topic [2]: Network device

  Reason: to debug network device related bugs in virtualization work
  Desired Effect:
  * detail about how a network device works (from user space tool to kernel space drivers).
  * training about the new network technology, e.g, SRIOV device, OpenVSwitch, etc
[edit]Virtualization

[edit]Topic [1]: virtualization technology(KVM in Kernel)

  Reason: directly related to our daily work (KVM in kernel, if anyone can give a training, it's very appreciated)
  Desired Effect: how kvm works, memory management, clock management, virtio, etc.
[edit]Security

[edit]Topic [1]: Introduction to LSM

  Summary: What is LSM? What's the fundamental thing in LSM?

  Category:[security]

  Reason || Description:
  I'm interesting in any stuff in kernel security;-)

  Desired Effect:
  In the best case, I may be able to hack the LSM by myself AFTER training.
[edit]Debug

[edit]Topic [1]: How to debug kernel panic

  Summary: How to debug kernel panic

  Category: General

  Reason || Description:
  When QA do the kernel testing, we sometimes trigger a kernel panic, and get the vmcore from kdump,
  if we can debug the vmcore by ourself, QA can help to figure out what trigger the bug to improve testing and provide better information

  Desired Effect:
  Learn how to use crash tool to debug a kernel vmcore. know its function and usage
