"Olaf Kirch"_email_"devel] Welcome Roger Zhou"
Dear all,

It is my pleasure to announce that today, Roger (Zhiqiang) Zhou had
his first day at SUSE, as the new manager of the Server Engineering Team
in Beijing. He is coming from WindRiver, where he headed a team of
people in the QA department. For the SLE department, this is a good
start of the Year of the Horse :-)

Please join me in welcoming Roger, and please support him in his new role
as much as you can.

Regards, and a happy new year!
Olaf

virtualization, kvm, package
""Bruce Rogers" <brogers@suse.com>"_email_"[opensuse-virtual] Proposed KVM related packaging changes"_20140211_1747
All,

I proposed making some KVM related packaging changes.

Motivation: Certain aspects of KVM support have changed over
time, and we should adjust to better align to the current state of
affairs. Among these are:
- the KVM modules have been included with the base kernel for
   quite some time
- there is no longer a qemu / qemu-kvm code split upstream
   qemu handles KVM completely 
- on x86, since v3.7 the KVM kernel modules are auto loaded based
   on detection of the required hardware virtualization features 

Our current kvm package originally included the KVM kernel modules,
as well as the QEMU binaries which supported KVM acceleration. As
noted above conditions have changed to where a kvm package has
little of its original purpose. The qemu package now has the basic
support for using KVM, and about the only meaningful use of a kvm
package would be for KVM related configuration or deliverables which
would not be appropriate (for whatever reason) in the qemu package.

The current content of the kvm package in OBS Virtualization includes:
- dependency on qemu package
- a recommends for virt-utils
- the legacy qemu-kvm executable, which is simply a wrapper for the
   QEMU provided executable with the parameter added that enables KVM
   acceleration. I believe this wrapper still provides the useful feature of
   having an executable name, compatible with prior kvm enabled usage.
- man page for qemu-kvm (which maps to qemu)
- a udev rule to change permissions and group ownership of /dev/kvm
   to be compatible with current libvirt usage as well as non-libvirt based
   (ie QEMU command line) kvm group administration.
- a qemu-ifup script which I find useful for testing and creating simple
   usage scenarios
- a kvm_stat tool which allows for monitoring of the lower level KVM
   module activities of the running KVM guests
- in the case of the SLES version of the kvm package, a place for additional
   modprobing, and support documentation, which in effect, rounds out
   the complete base support for KVM.

I propose that we rename (essentially) the kvm package to be qemu-kvm.
This is partly to reduce the number of maintained packages, as I envision
this simply being a subpackage of qemu. This will also make versioning
simpler to maintain. This package will maintain a dependency on qemu.
I propose that the permissions and group ownership udev rule be moved
from qemu-kvm to the base qemu package so that libvirt and etc. can
function without the qemu-kvm package, providing for a slightly smaller
package set and simpler configuration. I propose that the recommends
dependency for virt-utils be removed.

If the additional features and documentation still remaining in qemu-kvm
(the qemu-kvm wrapper and man page, the sample qemu-ifup script, the
kvm_stat debug utility, possible scripts for modprobing of additional kernel
modules which enhance qemu-kvm usage (eg vhost-net), and the support
documentation) are desired, then that package may be installed, but it is not
considered essential for basic KVM support.

The virt-utils package currently provides little value. It was envisioned as a
place to collect generic utilities useful for either KVM or Xen virtualization,
but to date very little has been done there. QEMU based utilities are now in
qemu-tools, and the only utility in virt-utils is the unmaintained
vm-snapshot-disk. I propose that we eliminate this package, but if there is
objection, and someone relies on the vm-snapshot-disk feature, we can keep
it, but not have it be part of the default set of rpms installed by KVM Host
Server pattern.

If there are dependencies on the kvm package name which will take time to
remove, we could have that stripped down package simply require qemu-kvm
in the interim.

Comments on these proposed changes are of course welcome.

Thanks,

Bruce Rogers

1), there is no need to install libXm.so.3 so as to libXm.so.4. according to Tim's blog. i installed the openmotif-libs(64bits), so i could prove that libXm.so.3 32bits is useless for me(i could start groupwise, open and send mail).
2), need install libpangox-1_0-0-32bit to avoid libwebrenderer crash.
JRE log(hs_err_pid5433.log):
# Problematic frame:
# C  [libwebrenderer.so+0xde3ff]  _ZN14WRSwingBrowser6WRInitEv+0x13f
#

2, about libpangox
Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
on internationalization. It can be used anywhere that text layout
is needed.
Pango forms the core of text and font handling for GTK+.
This is a compatibility library providing the obsolete pangox library
that is not shipped by Pango itself anymore.

xl snapshot coding
1, continue reading the qemu and xm code.
1), how to manage the snapshot list?
2), do i need to write all the snapshot image to one file?
3), it seems that libxl will stop the domain during libxl_domain_suspend. which means i need to avoid to stop the domain during snapshot.
4), in xen hvm save, how to deal with qemu process? from the function name, libxl__domain_save_device_model should handle this. but i do not know how it works.
and in xen pv save, do i need to care about qemu?
5), discuss with Chunyan. Chunyan suggest me make the disk snapshot work at first.
Chunyan said that in the xen old snapshot. xen will check the qcow2 snapshot in qcow2 file.

2, reference the follow patch for how to add the qmp command

virtualization, doc, some info about qemu with xen
http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/QEMU_Upstream

Xen Qemu Trees
These can be found on xenbits in 'qemu-upstream-VERSION.git' e.g. qemu-upstream-unstable.git, qemu-upstream-4.3-testing.git.
By default the Xen build system will clone and build both versions of Qemu from the branches on xenbits.

Using a distribution supplied version of Qemu
    ./configure --with-system-qemu=/path/some/qemu-bin/

override the binary to be used via device_model_override field in your xl vm configuration (other toolstacks may or may not expose this option). For example:
    device_model_override = "/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64"
Note that it is you responsibility to ensure that 'device_model_version' is set to either 'qemu-xen-traditional' or 'qemu-xen' as appropriate when overriding the binary to use.

1, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2514445/turning-off-auto-indent-when-pasting-text-into-vim

Pavel Shved:
To turn off autoindent when you paste code, there's a special "paste" mode.

Type

:set paste
Then paste your code. Note that the text in the tooltip now says -- INSERT (paste) --.

After you pasted your code, turn off the paste-mode, so that auto-indenting when you type works correctly again.

:set nopaste

3), it could be for diagnose. if a hardware works wrong, the interrupt counter will not increase.

5, the difference between PCI and PCIe
1), PCI is parallel, PCIe is serial.
2), the lane is given to the specific pcie devices. compare with PCI, the bandwidth is shared.

6, examples: emu 10k1(drivers/input/gameport/emu10k1-gp.c): translate from pci layer to gameport layer.

7, examples: /dev/null(drivers/char/mem.c)
1), the major number of mem device is 1.
# cat /proc/devices | head
Character devices:
  1 mem
  4 /dev/vc/0
  4 tty
  5 /dev/tty

linux, kernel, how the avoid the useless mismatch check
/*
 * modpost check for section mismatches during the kernel build.
 * A section mismatch happens when there are references from a
 * code or data section to an init section (both code or data).
 * The init sections are (for most archs) discarded by the kernel
 * when early init has completed so all such references are potential bugs.
 * For exit sections the same issue exists.
 *
 * The following markers are used for the cases where the reference to
 * the *init / *exit section (code or data) is valid and will teach
 * modpost not to issue a warning.  Intended semantics is that a code or
 * data tagged __ref* can reference code or data from init section without
 * producing a warning (of course, no warning does not mean code is
 * correct, so optimally document why the __ref is needed and why it's OK).
 *
 * The markers follow same syntax rules as __init / __initdata.
 */

fate, #316276: XEN: Bring back the Xen snapshot functionality

Hi, Jim, roger, chunyan

here is my current the idea and status about snapshot(fate#316276).

1, basic requirement about snapshot.
1), snapshot should includes save the memory and take the disk snapshot.
2), snapshot command: create, delete, revert, list and so on, reference the libvirt snapshot command in libvirt:
# virsh help |grep snapshot
    snapshot-create                Create a snapshot from XML
    snapshot-create-as             Create a snapshot from a set of args
    snapshot-current               Get or set the current snapshot
    snapshot-delete                Delete a domain snapshot
    snapshot-dumpxml               Dump XML for a domain snapshot
    snapshot-edit                  edit XML for a snapshot
    snapshot-info                  snapshot information
    snapshot-list                  List snapshots for a domain
    snapshot-parent                Get the name of the parent of a snapshot
    snapshot-revert                Revert a domain to a snapshot
3), disk type
(1), basically, support qcow2.
(2), the disk image do not support snapshot: raw. IIRC, RH support this.
(3), other disk: blktap3, lvm snapshot, btrfs, etc.
should we support qcow2 and raw(both use qdisk as backend) in the first version. and then considering others backend?

2, different implementation
1), libvirt qemu driver approach.
call the savevm, loadvm and other hmp command in libvirt qemu driver.
it was the first idea when we start this fate. but unfortunately, the xl toolstack do not support the hmp command, only qmp command is supported.
2), old snapshot implementation in sle.
base on qemu-xen. it would be some different compare with qemu upstream.

3, our approach.
1), use exist qmp api as many as possible. modify the qemu code if needed.
2), the current status of qmp.
query-block: could list the internal snapshot.
blockdev-snapshot-sync: take the external snapshot.
blockdev-snapshot-internal-sync: take the internal snapshot.
blockdev-snapshot-delete-internal-sync: delte the internal snapshot.
transaction: a sort of internal/extenal snapshot series.
3), so, for internal disk snapshot, only snapshot revert is missing. i could modify the code like qemu loadvm and old snapshot in sle.
4), snapshot the vm.
the basic flow of snapshot a vm could be:
(1), suspend domain.
(2), save vm memory(both xen and qemu save).
after vm save, the vm should paused. it lead to add a flag in xen/qemu save.
(3), disk snapshot by transaction qmp.
(4), resume domain.
5), migration disk and memory.
it is the stretch goals in xen OPW. and it need to call drive-mirror qmp. do we need support this?

4, current status
internal disk snapshot query, create is ok.

1, should we have the action item about how the opensource works in suse.
e.g. the suggestion about how to communicate with community.
which one is encourage. e.g. have a rest when take part in the community activity.
也就是说如果真的支持这个事情，应该有点干货。而不是走走形式。
