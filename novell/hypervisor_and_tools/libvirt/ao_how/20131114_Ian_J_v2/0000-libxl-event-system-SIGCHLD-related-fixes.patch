libxl's SIGCHLD handler is broken if libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always
and does not always work correctly with the fd registration system.

 1/3 libxl: event system: pass gc, not just ctx, to internal
 2/3 libxl: event system: Make
 3/3 libxl: event system: properly register the SIGCHLD

This is v2 of this series because when I reviewed it myself I found
that there was a critical missing ! in perhaps_removehandler, which
would remove the handler iff it was needed.  IMO this shows the
weakness of my testing arrangements.

I'd really appreciate some feedback on this from Bamvor or Jim.

Thanks,
Ian.
