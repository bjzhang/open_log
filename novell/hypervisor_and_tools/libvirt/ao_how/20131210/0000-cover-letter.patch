Subject: [PATCH 0/5] libxl: support operation different vm at the same time

the following patch use the async operation in libxl. with this patch,
libvirt could operation the different domain at the same time. and it
could avoid the assertion error mentioned by Jim in libxl lib.

i will add the job support in it, make it pretect and lock the operation
to same domain at the same time.

some discussion and TODO
1, how to deal with SIGCHLD?
in current libvirt code, the SIGCHLD is used by virNetServerAddSignalHandler
in src/libxl/lxc_controller.c. so i direct waitpid for all the children.

do i need to improve the code in ao_how_wait?
i could use the setpgid change the pgid in fork replacement and waitid to
wait all the children at the same time. but it still need a sleep or
virCondWaitUntil in the loop of ao_how_wait.

2, i will improve the child_info.

3, add the error handling.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (5):
  introduce async opeartion in libxl driver private
  call ao function in create, save, restore and destroy
  ao improve: avoid use ao in autostart domain
  improve ao: move libxl_event_register_callbacks before
    libxl_domain_create_xxx in order to support ao in create
  improve ao: handle shutdown event in thread
