+=head1 NAME
+
+xl.snapshot.cfg - XL Domain Snapshot Configuration File Syntax
+
+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+without snapshot configuration file, xl snapshot-create could create internal
+domain snapshot or internal disk snapshot. To create a user-defined domain
+snapshot, xl requires a domain snapshot config file. Typically these live in
+`/var/lib/xen/snapshots/UUID/snapshotdata-d.NAME.libxl-json` where
+UUID is the uuid of domain and the NAME is name of snapshot.
+it is highly recommend that the external file snapshot should locate the same
+directory with snapshot configuration file and memory save image.
+here is two examples for internal domain snapshot and external domain snapshot:
+"/etc/xen/examples/xlsnapshot.internal", "/etx/xen/examples/xlsnapshot.external".
+
+=head1 SYNTAX
+
+A domain config file consists of a series of C<KEY=VALUE> pairs. it share the
+same rules with xl.cfg

+describe the location of memory save image, this image is as same as the image
+in "xl save". the value could be the full directory of the location of memory
+save image or "yes" which means `/var/lib/xen/snapshots/UUID/NAME.save`.
+if ignored, this snapshot will be a disk only snapshot.
+
+=item B<disk=[ "DISK_SPEC_STRING", "DISK_SPEC_STRING", ...]>
+
+the disk snapshot description. See F<docs/misc/xl-disk-configuration.txt> for
+full description. for internal snapshot, user should provide vdev. for external
