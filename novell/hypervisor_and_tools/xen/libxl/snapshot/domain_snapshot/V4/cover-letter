here is the fourth version about domain snapshot documents, the previous version
is here[1][2][3].

there are lots of potential feature about snapshots. for now, i focus on
providing the api for libvirt libxl driver in order to support the same
functionality compare with libvirt qemu driver.
i plan to work on other "advanced feature" after my first stage patch ack.

there are two types of snapshots supported by libxl: disk snapshot and domain
snapshot and four types of operations: create, delete, list and revert.

Disk snapshot will only be crash-consistent if the domain is running. Disk
snapshots can also be internal (qcow2) or external (snapshot in one file, delta
in another).

Domain snapshots include disk snapshots and domain state, allowing to resume
the domain from the same state when the snapshot was created. This type of
snapshot is also referred to as a domain checkpoint or system checkpoint.

In libvirt, there is a something like resource manager for domain snapshot
managements. So, in libxl, all these information is transfered through
libxl_domain_snapshot struct. xl will manage the snapshot by itself.

Domain snapshot create means save domain state and do disk snapshots.
At the beginning of domain snapshot create, it will check whether it is
snapshotable. it is snapshotable if all the disk is qdisk backed.

Domain snapshot revert means rollback the current snapshot state. and
Because the limitation of the qemu qmp, the revert could only support domain
snapshot with internal disk snapshot. revert the domain snapshot with external
snapshot doest not support.

there are live flag in snasphot configuration file, it will be save domain
memory and do external disk snapshot. to make the thing simple, i do not want
to implement in my first verion of patch.

about non-qdisk backend.

thanks. do you mean call these utils in libxl__exec? it seems that only a few
binary called by this functions: bootloader, libxl-save-helper, qemu-dm,
qemu-system-i386.
the core function of vhd_util snapshot is vhd_snashot which defined in
(tools/blktap2/include/libvhd.h, /usr/lib64/libvhd.so). although it included in
xen-devel package in opensuse12.3. maybe it is a better choice?

changes since v3:

changes since v2:
1), reorgnized the whole docments.
2), do not export the dedicated the disk snapshot commands.
3), others changes according to Ian and Jim's comment.
