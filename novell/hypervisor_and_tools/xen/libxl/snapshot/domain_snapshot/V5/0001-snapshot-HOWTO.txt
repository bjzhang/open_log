* Overview:
    Two levels of snapshot: disk snapshot and VM snapshot
    Four types of snapshot operations: create, delete, list and revert.

    * disk snapshot
        Disk snapshot is crash-consistent if the domain is running. It could be
        "internal" (like in qcow2 format, snapshot and delta are both in one
        image file), or "external" (snapshot in one file, delta in another).

    * VM snapshot
        VM snapshot includes disk snapshots and domain state saving. VM could
        be resumed to the very state when the snapshot was created. This kind of
        snapshot is also referred to as a domain checkpoint or system checkpoint.

        "VM snapshot create" means saving domain state and doing disk snapshots.
        Before creating VM snapshot, it will check whether it is snapshotable.

        "VM snapshot revert" means rolling back to the state of indicated
        snapshot.

* VM Snapshot

    * Create Snapshot:

        User could create internal or external snapshot with or without config
        file. Refer to xl.snapshot.5 ( RFC Doc 5/5) for details of the config file.

        Use Cases:

        1), create an internal snapshot with default name (autogenerated name:
            epoch second from 1, Jan 1970). Internal snapshot is only supported
            by qcow2 format.
            e.g.:
                #xl snapshot-create your_domain

        2), create an internal snapshot with specific snapshot name.
            e.g.:
                #xl snapshot-create -n domain_snapshot_name your_domain

        3), create an external snapshot
            To create an external snapshot, you must specify a config file, in
            which you could specify the external path and the snapshot type in
            'disk'.
            e.g.:
                #xl snapshot-create your_domain config_file

            #cat snapshot_external_config_file
            name = "1397207577"
            description="Snapshot after OS installation. External snapshot"
            memory="yes"
            disk=['hda=/var/lib/xen/snapshots/<domain_uuid>/disk_hda.qcow2,type=qcow2',
                  'hdc=/var/lib/xen/snapshots/<domain_uuid>/disk_hdc.qcow2,type=qcow2']

        4), create disk-only snapshot, which means no memory state will be saved
            in this snapshot. Could be internal and external.
            e.g.:
                (internal)
                #xl snapshot-create --disk-only your_domain

                (external)
                #xl snapshot-create your_domain config_file

            disk-only snapshot can appy to selected disks or all disks.

            specific config file (to indicate which disks to be snapshotted).

    * List Snapshot:

        Use Cases:

        1), list short information of all snapshots for the specific domain.
            Short information include snapshot name, creation time, the domain
            state when create snapshot, whether it is a disk only snapshot.

            e.g.:
                #xl snapshot-list your_domain

        2), list full information of one snapshot for specific domain
            e.g.:
                #xl snapshot-list -l your_domain domain_snapshot_name

        3), list full information of all snapshots for specific domain.
            e.g.:
                #xl snapshot-list -l your_domain

    * Delete snapshot:

        Use Cases:

        1), delete a snapshot for specific domain.
            This operation will delete all relative to this snapshot
            e.g.:
               #xl snapshot-delete -n domain_snapshot_name your_domain

    * Revert snapshot:

        Use Cases:

        Curently, only internal snapshot revert is supportted.
        Following command will revert an internal disk snapshot and memory state.
        e.g.:
            #xl snapshot-revert -n domain_snapshot_name your_domain
