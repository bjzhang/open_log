introduce the libxl_domain_snapshot for domain snapshot operation.
the meaning of each member in libxl_domain_snapshot is same as the
xl.snapshot. reference snapshot-HOWTO.txt about how to use.

the libxl_domain_struct and libxl_disk_snapshot in defined in libxl_types.idl,
which will generate the following libxl-json helper functions:
char *libxl_domain_snapshot_to_json(libxl_ctx *ctx, libxl_domain_snapshot *p);
int libxl_domain_snapshot_from_json(libxl_ctx *ctx, libxl_domain_snapshot *p, const char *s);
these functions is useful when load/store domain snapshot configuration file
(libxl-json format).
