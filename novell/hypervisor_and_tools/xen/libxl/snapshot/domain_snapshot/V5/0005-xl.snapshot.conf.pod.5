=head1 NAME

xl.snapshot.cfg - XL Domain Snapshot Configuration File Syntax

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Without snapshot configuration file, xl snapshot-create could create internal
domain snapshot or internal disk snapshot. To create a user-defined domain
snapshot, xl requires a domain snapshot config file. Typically these live in
`/var/lib/xen/snapshots/UUID/snapshotdata-d.NAME.libxl-json` where
UUID is the uuid of domain and the NAME is name of snapshot.
It is highly recommend that the external file snapshot should locate the same
directory with snapshot configuration file and memory save image.
See snapshot-HOWTO.txt.
