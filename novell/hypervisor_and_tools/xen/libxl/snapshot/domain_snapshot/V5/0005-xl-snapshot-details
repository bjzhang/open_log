Some discussion on xl snapshot-xxx implementation

the possible question would be why there is no universe api for domain
snapshot?
this is my initial target while working on snapshot. with the common api,
different toolstack(xl or libvirt) could call the same api for the same
operation. life would be eaiser compare to the domain create, restore and
...
the reason why i could not provide common api is that it is hard to handle
the ao things in api. e.g. in domain snapshot create, libvirt may wait the
memory save by waiting the ao complete flag.
the secondary reason is that i could share more functions in xl command
with xl snapshot command. share the code mean easy to maintenance.

"xl snapshot-create"

1), parse domain snapshot configuration file.
2), save domain memory through save_domain if it is not a disk only
snapshot.
3), take disk snapshot by libxl_disk_snapshot_create according to
libxl_domain_snapshot.
4), it will save snapshot configuration(libxl-json format) to
"/var/lib/xen/snapshots/domain_uuid/snapshotdata-<snapshot_name>.libxl-json"

"xl snapshot-list"
1), read all the domain snapshot configuration file(libxl-json format) from
"/var/lib/xen/snapshots/domain_uuid". parse each file into
libxl_domain_snapshot struct.
2), display short or full information from these libxl_domain_snapshot array.

"xl snapshot-delete"

"xl snapshot-revert"

flow: destroy domain -> revert disk snapshot -> restore domain

idealy, i should use libxl__xc_domain_restore for domain memory restore. but i
will be a issue when the domain configuration is different between current vm
and snapshot. so, in my current implementation, firstly, i destroy the current
domain. and after revert disk snapshot, i restore the domain through
create_domain with proper dom_info. so, the revert is not pull the domain
status back. it is different from qemu snapshot implementation, qemu is pull
the domain back to the snapshot point with loadvm hmp.
