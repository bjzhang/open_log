Here is the fifth version about domain snapshot documents, the previous version
is here[1][2][3][4].

There are lots of potential features about snapshots. Now we try to focus on
basic features, providing API for libvirt libxl driver which supports the same
functionality as libvirt qemu driver. Advanced features are deferred to the 
next phase.

Libxl manages the domain snapshot information through the configuration file.
All snapshot informatin for specific domain is stored here:
"/var/lib/xen/snapshots/<domain_uuid>/snapshotdata-<snapshot_name>.libxl-json",
This file is one for per snapshot per domain.

Following features are not implemented in the current phase:

- non-qdisk backend
After some discussion with Jim, it seems that the
snapshot of these device could be done by different utils through libxl__exec.
For tap/tap2, utilities are td-util(e.g. "td-util snapshot") or vhd-util.
For lvm, snapshot create, delete, and revert could be done by lvcreate,
lvremove, and lvconvert respectively.

- live snapshot.
i do not know how it should work exactly. if we talk about live memory save,
i guess it is simialr to live migration. but i am not sure how to sync with
live memory save and disk transaction.

changes since v4:
add docs/misc/snapshot-HOWTO.txt
add the explanation of domain snapshot api.

changes since v3:
split one document into difference document, hope it will be easier to
review and discuss.

changes since v2:
1), reorgnized the whole docments.
2), do not export the dedicated the disk snapshot commands.
3), others changes according to Ian and Jim's comment.
