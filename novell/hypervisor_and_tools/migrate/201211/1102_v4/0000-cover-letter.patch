Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Add lock in libxl

These two patches implement a lock for long-running
job(save, dump and migration) and normal job which will
return in short time but maybe affect the state of virtual
machine.

With these patches, the normal job could not execute while
the long-ruuning job or other normal job is running.

In order to tracking these job, job type for normal job and
long-ruuning job(will be called as async job in code) is
defined.

The abort job is called while user want to cancel such async
job. Note that there is no cancellation function for async
job in xenlight stack. So, abort function just block the
cancellation of user.

Update compare to v1:
1, remove migration relative job functions from lock patch.
2, update comments according to upstream's comments.

Bamvor Jian Zhang (2):
  Introduce a lock for libxl long-running api
  Add lock for libxl api
