# Enabling pipelining reduces the number of SSH operations required to execute a module on the remote server, by executing many ansible modules without actual file transfer. This can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled, however when using “sudo:” operations you must first disable ‘requiretty’ in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts.
# By default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with sudoers configurations that have requiretty (the default on many distros), but is highly recommended if you can enable it, eliminating the need for Accelerated Mode:
# CAUTIONS: ONLY enable it after "grep requiretty /etc/sudo* -R" get false or nothing. This is the default in my system(centos7.0 and opensuse leap 42.3)
pipelining = True
# The value ‘implicit’ is the default, which means that the fact cache will be ignored and facts will be gathered per play unless ‘gather_facts: False’ is set. The value ‘explicit’ is the inverse, facts will not be gathered unless directly requested in the play. The value ‘smart’ means each new host that has no facts discovered will be scanned, but if the same host is addressed in multiple plays it will not be contacted again in the playbook run. This option can be useful for those wishing to save fact gathering time. Both ‘smart’ and ‘explicit’ will use the fact cache:
gathering = explicit
