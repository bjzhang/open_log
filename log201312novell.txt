16:06- finish coding, try to compile.
2), ?-? 找lance

(1), discuss with Chunyan.
(2), try to write hvm snapshot code.

1, ref:
Linux 多线程应用中如何编写安全的信号处理函数
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/linux/l-cn-signalsec/

2, consider call libxl_child_reaped in libvirt event handler. for now, call it direct from SIGCHLD handler.
in order to do this, i need get ctx in fork replacement.

3, add ao in each domain, do i need to add child in to each domain?
i handle child in order to call libxl_child_reaped. no other operation relative to the child.

4, today, only test SIGCHLD in libvirt. add ao in domain priv later.

5, error
if i waitpid, it would be influence the virProcessWait.
2013-12-02T17:26:27.937521+08:00 bjz-rd2 libvirtd[6240]: child info overflow!!! (pid<6758> status<256>)
2013-12-02T17:26:27.938603+08:00 bjz-rd2 libvirtd[6240]: unable to wait for process 6758: No child processes

1), try
-    pid = waitpid(-1, &status, WNOHANG);
+    pid = waitpid(0, &status, WNOHANG);

not work.

2), how about fork a new process for libxl?
is it acceptable in libvirt? at least, it is dangerous.

3), discuss with Gaoyan, his suggestion:
(1), direct loop. do not register signal action.
loop {
    check ao_complete
    waitpid, waitpid ...
    sleep(1)
}
(2), we do not know the status in BSD.
       __WNOTHREAD (since Linux 2.4)
              Do not wait for children of other threads  in  the  same  thread
              group.  This was the default before Linux 2.4.

(3), wait the specfic process group through setpgid and waitid.
int waitid(idtype_t idtype, id_t id, siginfo_t *infop, int options);
       idtype == P_PGID
              Wait for any child whose process group ID matches id.

6, TODO
1), try 5-3)-(1), and do others works. deal with it later.
