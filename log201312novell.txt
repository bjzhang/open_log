2, consider call libxl_child_reaped in libvirt event handler. for now, call it direct from SIGCHLD handler.
in order to do this, i need get ctx in fork replacement.

3, add ao in each domain, do i need to add child in to each domain?
i handle child in order to call libxl_child_reaped. no other operation relative to the child.

4, today, only test SIGCHLD in libvirt. add ao in domain priv later.

1), try
-    pid = waitpid(-1, &status, WNOHANG);

not work.

2), how about fork a new process for libxl?
is it acceptable in libvirt? at least, it is dangerous.

3), discuss with Gaoyan, his suggestion:
(1), direct loop. do not register signal action.
loop {
    check ao_complete
    waitpid, waitpid ...
    sleep(1)
}
(2), we do not know the status in BSD.
       __WNOTHREAD (since Linux 2.4)
              Do not wait for children of other threads  in  the  same  thread
              group.  This was the default before Linux 2.4.

(3), wait the specfic process group through setpgid and waitid.
int waitid(idtype_t idtype, id_t id, siginfo_t *infop, int options);
       idtype == P_PGID
              Wait for any child whose process group ID matches id.

(4), another idea is signalfd which could convert the signal to fd, it is better than sigaction things, but it could not solved my problem.

1, check the status:
WEXITSTATUS(status): returns true if the child terminated normally.
WIFSIGNALED(status): returns the exit status of the child.
WIFSIGNALED(status): returns true if the child process was terminated by a signal.
WTERMSIG(status):    returns the number of the signal that caused the child process to terminate.
WCOREDUMP(status):   returns true if the child produced a core dump.
WIFSTOPPED(status):  returns true if the child process was stopped by delivery of a signal.
WSTOPSIG(status):    returns the number of the signal which caused the child to stop.
WIFCONTINUED(status):returns true if the child process was resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.

2, it is ok after i add this code. and even ok after comment the code.
so, it might be ok i issue the libxl_child_reaped to the qemu parent process.
TODO: discuss it with xen community.

3, some corner case
1), in libxlEventHandler: the ao_complete will not be got because it will handled by libxlEventHandler itself.
2), libxlStateAutoStart: ao things is not ready.
solution: do not use ao. the domain started one by one.
3), FIXME: so as to libxlVmReap: use sync mode in libxlEventHandler. it will fail when multi-domain running.(similar to the assertion from jim)
(1), how about create thread for this?
TODO: thread or thread pool?
ref: qemuProcessEventHandler.
the thread pool seems more clear and easier for event handling.
for now, do not use thread pool. coding finish, try it tomorrow.
4), about reconnect? TODO

This sounds like interesting work. Should you discover any security issues I would like to encourage you to please contact security@xen.org in the first instance. The Xen security problem response process is at http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html .

There is a book "The Definitive Guide to the Xen Hypervisor" which I've not read myself but I have heard recommended (it's a bit dated, but still largely relevant I think)

http://www.amazon.com/The-Definitive-Guide-Xen-Hypervisor/dp/013234971X

If you are particularly interesting in memory management then a good understanding of the architectural (e.g. x86) memory management stuff is pretty much a prerequisite. As far as x86 PV memory management goes the basic principals are still those which are outlined in the original "Xen and the Art of Virtualization" paper from SOSP 2003.

Ultimately there isn't much substitute for being able to read and follow the code. Tools like TAGS or cscope, or even just grep, are a useful aid for this.

2, grant table in arm, Ian C
The DT provided to guests (including dom0) includes a Xen node which, among other things, describes an MMIO region which can be safely used for grant table mappings (i.e. it is a hole in the physical address space). For domU we provide a hardcoded values based on our hardcoded guest virtual machine layout. However for dom0 we need to fit in with the underlying platform. Leaving this hardcoded was an oversight which on some platforms could result in the grant table overlaying RAM or MMIO regions which are in use by domain 0.

For the 4.4 release do as we did with the dom0 evtchn PPI and provide a hook for the platform code to supply a suitable hardcoded address for the platform (derived from reading the data sheet). Platforms which do not provide the hook get the existing address as a default.

After 4.4 we should switch to selecting a region of host RAM which is not RAM in the guest address map. This should be more flexible and safer but the patch was looking too complex for 4.4.

Platform Gnttab Address ========

exynos5.c 0xb0000000, confirmed and tested by Julien.
sunxi.c 0x01d00000, confirmed in data sheet.
midway.c 0xff800000, confirmed by Andre, boot tested by Ian.
vexpress.c 0xb0000000, existing hardcoded value was selected for vexpress.
omap5.c 0x4b000000, confirmed by Baozi 
xgene-storm.c 0x1f800000, confirmed by Pranavkumar

1), TODO: check 0x01d00000 in sunxi? which module?

3, support more than 4g on arm32
arm32 currently only makes use of memory which is contiguous with the first bank. On the Midway platform this means that we only use 4GB of the 8GB available.

Change things to make use of non-contiguous memory regions with the restriction that we require that at least half of the total span of the RAM addresses contain RAM. The frametable is currently not sparse and so this restriction avoids problems with allocating enormous amounts of memory for the frametable to cover holes in the address space and exhausting the actual RAM.

50% is arguably too restrictive. 4GB of RAM requires 32MB of frametable on arm32 and 56M on arm64, so we could probably cope with a lower ratio of actual RAM. However half is nice and conservative.

arm64 currently uses all banks without regard for the size of the frametable, which I have observed causing problems on models. Implement that same restriction as arm32 there.

Long term we should look at moving to a pfn compression based scheme similar to x86, which removes the holes from the frametable.

There were some bogus/outdated comments scattered around this code which I have removed.

ttbcr in arm32 and aarch64. register_t is 32 or 64 according to architecture. so as to.READ/WRITE_SYSREG.
Ian C.
1), I think that actually only this hunk is required.

Actually, the correct type to use is register_t (which is defined to be the "native" register size, 32- or 64-bit as appropriate). That avoids the ifdef.

The READ/WRITE_SYSREG macros are also defined to deal in the "native" bit width so the other hunks are unnecessary.

The SYSREG32/64 variants are for use with a register which is a fixed width independent of the platform.

2),
Actually, it turns out there a few other places where ttbcr is incorrectly stored in a 32-bit variable. Including one which needed some careful consideration before it was safe to change. Here is what I came up with.

Xen only uses the device emulation capabilities of qemu and not the

if not, i could not release the vm lock during domain destroy.
how about using job in reboot, shutdown, destroy?
    will it be affected by the domain id changing?
if the destroy event is destroy, it is ok. but if it is the reboot. it should not conflict with the job started in libxlVmStart.
TODO: reference how qemu handle it.

1, about boot xen on EFI
Chen Banzi reply to Ian C
> Are you using the EFI stub with Linux or are you launching via a
> bootloader e.g. Grub-EFI?

After reading the source code, I think it is neither the EFI stub
or a bootloader. A Linux Loader EFI application has been developed
for ARM in EFI. It is able to boot Linux either by tagged list or
dtb method. However, it hardcoded the start address of 0x80000
when loading Linux kernel, which make it unworkable for Xen after
paging is enable. But I’m not sure whether there would be other
problems for it to boot Xen. And I’ll continue to work on it until
it can boot Xen successfully at the end.

(At least, there are early printk messages on the UART now, :-))

1, how to test huge pages.
> The code has been tested with LTP.

Hello,

Could you please test how this series interacts with huge pages? So please run LTP with THP enabled and always active: TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=y TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_ALWAYS=y (for both 4KB and 64KB base page sizes). This will give the pmd level code a workout.

Then could you please try libhugetlbfs to test HugeTLB? git://git.code.sf.net/p/libhugetlbfs/code (next branch) with the following enabled: HUGETLBFS=y

Please run the test suite against 2MB, 1GB (4KB base pages) and 512MB (64KB base pages) huge pages.

To set aside 1GB huge pages at boot time, please add the following to the kernel command line: hugepagesz=1G hugepages=x where x is the number of 1GB huge pages you can get away with :-).

For 2MB and 512MB: echo x > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages again where x is the number of huge pages to set aside.

Ensure that the hugetlbfs filesystem is mounted: mount -t hugetlbfs hugetlbfs /mnt/hugepages

Then make check

The libhugetlbfs tests above will test out the pud and pmd interactions, please let me know whether or not anything breaks.

Thanks, --Steve

xtl_logger_destroy is called in libxlDomainObjPrivateDispose
    from virDomainObjDispose
    from virObjectUnref(dom);
    from virDomainObjListRemove

but it is used in the libxl_ctx_free later:
    xtl_logger_destroy(priv->logger);
    ...
    libxl_ctx_free(priv->ctx);

modify:
    put xtl_logger_destroy after libxl_ctx_free.

it works after this.

(1), patch commit message:
fix segfault when domain create fail

there is segfault in libxl_ctx_free. because the log output handler vmessage
is empty at that time.
this situation is caused by xtl_logger_destroy. it free such handler before
libxl_ctx_free in virDomainObjListRemove.
move xtl_logger_destroy after libxl_ctx_free could fix this bug.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi,

We are happy to announce the first Alpha images of SLE 12, fulfilling these
milestone criterias:

o Milestone: Make sure that Autobuild/BuildService setup is in place and
  working
o Internal snapshot only, based on Factory, not released outside of SUSE


We offer 3 DVD ISOs: DVD1 contains the binaries, the second
DVD the sources and the third DVD the debuginfo packages.
The final product will not contain the debuginfo packages on the media.


This is the first Alpha, nearly all features are missing. It's based on
openSUSE Factory, with the filelist adjusted for SLES.
Some packages are still missing.

Never-the-less, you can already check if the package selection makes sense.
Especially if there are packages on the medias you do not think should be
delivered, or if you miss some packages that should be there.

In such cases, be so kind to check if there's already a feature request for
those, and if not, file one. (As SLE 12 products are past feature deadline,
file against the SP1 of the product, and add the responsible Release Manager to
the feature. He'll take care t move the feature to the right product(s) and to
add the package/remove the package from the package list.)


You can get the iso images from:

  http://download.suse.de/install/SLE-12-Server-Alpha1/
  http://download.suse.de/install/SLE-12-Desktop-Alpha1/
  http://download.suse.de/install/SLE-12-HA-Alpha1/
  http://download.suse.de/install/SLE-12-Server-VMware-Alpha1/



Next steps:

We will split off of Factory on January 7th.
Alpha 2 submission deadline is 

for base/core packages or packages with a huge dependency list:
        Friday January 10th, 15:00 CET

for leaf packages:
	Monday January 13th, 17:00 CET


Happy testing!

explain why i need async and libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop
but if we do not use async. if we only use job. the same api(create, restore. or others) will be called at the same time. which will lead to sighandler_ctx conflict.

Jim Fehlig: even if those are on different domains?
e.g. create domA, restore domB

yes. it is global varible. because there is only one sighandler.
reference libxl__sigchld_installhandler
    if (sigchld_owner != CTX) {
        struct sigaction ours;

        assert(!sigchld_owner);
        sigchld_owner = CTX;

i think this segment code lead to the segfault you mentioned in Sep.
Jim Fehlig: hmm
and it is only occurred when we have jobs.
because if we do not have job, the api could only called one by one .
Jim Fehlig: ok, starting to understand/remember :)
this is the start point of my async work recently .
i work on it, because i do not find any other solution about this assertion.
and when i working on the async, i need to choice the between libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop and libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always.
at first, i want libxl lib could manage the child exit.
Jim Fehlig: yes, understood
but as Ian C mentioned in email. it is depend on only one ctx in the whole libvirt.  which is conflict with libxl driver.
so, i could only use the mainloop.
which lead to the SIGCHLD handler in libvirt. and libvirt do not want it.
it usually use waitpid. so as to me.
i use the waitpid wait all the child created by the same domain id.
reference the code in ao_how_wait.
0002-introduce-async-opeartion-in-libxl-driver-private.patch
patch 0005-call-ao-functions.patch use the ao thing introduced in patch 0002-introduce-async-opeartion-in-libxl-driver-private..
around patch 0005, 0003, 0004, 0006 focus on improve the ao things. i seperate these tree patches from patch 0005, it might be ealier to review.
the last two patch only the rebase of your job patch.
and from patch 2 to 8 is the whole thing about ao and job.
patch 0001 is a bug fix. such bug is existed with or without ao and job. i think we could send it seperate and earlier.

libxl, snapshot
1, Xen OPW project.
it is not selected by OPW finally.
1), VM Snapshots
http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/OutreachProgramForWomen/Round7#VM_Snapshots
Date of insert: 16/01/2013
Mentor: Anthony Perard <anthony.perard@citrix.com>
Difficulty: Medium
Skills Needed: C programming
Description: Although xl is capable of saving and restoring a running VM, it is not currently possible to create a snapshot of the disk together with the rest of the VM.
QEMU is capable of creating, listing and deleting disk snapshots on QCOW2 and QED files, so even today, issuing the right commands via the QEMU monitor, it is possible to create disk snapshots of a running Xen VM. xl and libxl don't have any knowledge of these snapshots, don't know how to create, list or delete them.
This project is about implementing disk snapshots support in libxl, using the QMP protocol to issue commands to QEMU. Users should be able to manage the entire life-cycle of their disk snapshots via xl.
The candidate should also explore ways to integrate QEMU disk snapshots and disk mirroring into the regular Xen save/restore mechanisms and provide a solid implementation for xl/libxl.
Outcomes:
Basic goal: disk snapshots can be handled entirely by xl.
Stretch goals: xl can automatically save a disk snapshot at the time of saving a VM. xl can also mirror the disk of a VM between two hosts and can do that automatically at the time of VM migration.
Steps:
Basic steps:
Study libxl APIs for storage
Study QEMU QMP commands for VM snapshots
Implement support for QMP snapshots commands in libxl
Implement VM snapshots functionalities in libxl using the QMP functions previously written
Add VM snapshot commands to XL
Stretch goals:
Add VM snapshot functionalities to libxl save/restore and migration functions
Evaluate QEMU QMP disk mirroring capabilities (QMP command "drive-mirror")
Implement support for QMP drive-mirror command in libxl
Hook disk mirroring into libxl VM save/restore and migration functions (migrating a VM from one host to another is also capable of migrating the VM disk from the two hosts).

2, plan
1), follow the steps above, try the basic step.

3, write a test code.

arm, kvm
If a KVM guest accesses memory that is outside its memory map (so no MMIO and no RAM), KVM will return -ENOSYS to userland, causing QEMU to do an abort() and kill the whole guest. This happens while executing dmidecode on ARM, which mmaps /dev/mem and scans the first Megabyte of memory for a DMI BIOS signature (sic!). Of course this is silly, but in any case crashing the whole guest does not seems appropriate. So lets mimic native hardware's behavior in this case and inject a Data Abort exception into the guest. In the previous case this will crash dmidecode with SIGSEGV, but keeps the guest alive.

[Qemu-devel] [PATCH 5/7] hw/arm/boot: Allow easier swapping in of differ
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-11/msg03741.html
For AArch64 we will obviously require a different set of
primary and secondary boot loader code fragments. However currently
we hardcode the offsets into the loader code where we must write
the entrypoint and other data into arm_load_kernel(). This makes it
hard to substitute a different loader fragment, so switch to a more
flexible scheme where instead of a raw array of instructions we use
an array of (instruction, fixup-type) pairs that indicate which
words need special action or data written into them.

Hi.
My name is Micha Bar-Shalev.
I work at chippc.
We make thin clients.
We are in the process of developing are next product.
I like to know what to you think of the gstreamer and x11  hardware acceleration in the A31?
I am following your footsteps "running xen on allwinner sunxi powered devices" .
I have  lichee kernel that I have built from source.
Do you think I can use it instead of the kernel  in "sun7i-xen-dom0"?

10x for all your great job.

> Hi.

nice to meet you.

for gstreamer, if you talk about CedarX, there is a work about CedarX in
A20[1]. there is a page about Reverse Engineering for CedarX, but it is a
little bit out of date.
meanwhile in the kernel code, it says[3]
    This is the driver for sunxi video decoder, including h264/
    mpeg4/mpeg2/vc1/rmvb.
    To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
    module will be called cedar_dev.

for X11, i only know about the reverse engineer about PowerVR GPU. i do not
know the exact status about when it could be used on A31.

there is a A31 powered pad could run ubuntu, i guess it solve all these issues.
but i forget its name. it was a project in something like kickstart.

for xen on arm, you need kernel 3.8 at least. i guess lichee kernel is an
android kernel, maybe 3.4?

irc, virtualization, arm, discuss about cache maintenance
22:33 <ijc> maz: I wonder if you could advise on some cache issues with Xen (I realise a bit offtopic on #kvm-arm, but it was suggested that I might find you here ;-) If there is a better forum or you want to join #xenarm instead we can take it there...)
<ijc> This is the issue of coherency between the tools which build the domain and write the initial images (kernel, dtb etc) to the guest memory space and the guest VCPU which starts with MMU and caches disabled.
<ijc> I understand that KVM is going the route of flushing when it faults in a guest page and the caches are disabled, but under Xen we don't dynamically fault in the RAM into the stage 2, so that's not really an option.
<ijc> The most preferable solution seems to be to do the cache flush from userspace after we write the blobs. I think we require a dcache flush to PoC (dc cvac or dccmvac). But it has been suggested to me that a PoUIS or LoUIS might be suitable. Does that make sense? Or was that suggestion perhaps confusing dcache and icache flushes?
<ijc> A PoU would be more convenient on v7 because we could use the existing cacheflush syscall, if we need PoC then we need to enhance that. On v8 we just use the instructions directly...

00:22 <chazy-> ijc: if you use instruction directly on v8 from user space, how does that work with the APM L3 controller thingy that needs explicit flushing via mmio commands?
<ijc> chazy-: The APM controller needs explicit flushing? I thought they said it was "transparent" in the sense that it snooped the L2 traffic?
<ijc> apatel: ^
<chazy-> ijc: I don't remember the details exactly, but I think that only worked if the MMU was on, if the MMU is off in the guest requests may go directly to main memory, but the content you wrote from user space may sit in the L3.
<chazy-> or did I get this backwards.  apatel, maz ?
<ijc> chazy-: I think the normal PoU/PoC flushes will also flush the L3 ("transparently"), I wasn't aware of any need to manually fiddle with the L3, regardless of MMU state
<chazy-> ijc: I should go back and read that thread.  IIRC only one of the PoU/PoC properly flushes the L3, which was one of the problems they were faced with.
<chazy-> the other was related to when you actually turn the MMU on.
<chazy-> then all of the sudden you may hit content in the cache instead of what the early boot code wrote directly to main memory
<chazy-> because the system expects the cache to be empty, but it may not be.
<chazy-> because you're running in a VM.
<chazy-> well, I'm clearly not remembering things perfectly well, I should really go back and read that thread again.

12:05 <apatel> ijc: chazy: The APM X-Gene L3-cache is transperent to all CPUs. All cache PoU operations for APM X-Gene are upto L2-cache. All cache PoC operations for APM X-Gene are upto RAM because L3-cache controller monitors PoC cache operations from the CPU to maintain its own state.
<apatel> ijc: chazy: The issue of Guest not seeing correct contents when booting with MMU disabled also exist for any type of Host (not necessarily X-Gene). Other ARM host don't see this issue because they don't have L3-cache and their L2-cache is usually small (few hundred KBs). The issue manifest easily on APM X-Gene becasue we have an external L3-caceh of 8MB.
* inara has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
<apatel> ijc: chazy: Only PoC cache operations ensure that same cache contents are visible to all coherant agents (including all CPUs) and cache contents are in-sync with RAM. The PoU cache operation only ensures that all CPUs see same contents. From the semantics of PoC and PoU, it is also becomes clear that PoC takes more machine cycles than PoU.
<apatel> ijc: chazy: PoC cache operations (DC CVAC) from user space will work for APM L3-cache. Flushing cache contents by VA upto PoC is not a complete solution but it definetly solves issue of Guess booting with MMU disabled.
* inara (~inara@li125-242.members.linode.com) has joined #kvm-arm
<apatel> ijc: chazy: The issue of Guest enabling/disabling MMU on-the-fly is the one where we don't have clear solution. The real issues is that  when Guest is running with MMU-off nothing prevents other CPUs to speculatively prefetch Guest RAM contents because other CPUs may see Guest RAM as cacheable memory due to Host-side mappings of the Guest RAM.
<apatel> ijc: chazy: Again the issue of Guest enabling/disabling MMU on-the fly is also not APM X-Gene specific. This issue exist for other ARM host too, so far this has not manifested on other ARM host due to relatively small caches.

(01:22:24 PM) Jim Fehlig: we can talk later about the ao patches later
(01:23:58 PM) Jim Fehlig: like I said on the call, I need to look at them closer
(01:24:39 PM) Jim Fehlig: I don't really like the idea of having all the child info in the domain private object
(01:25:17 PM) Jim Fehlig: there could be child info that has nothing to do with the domain private object right?
(01:25:30 PM) Jim Fehlig: e.g. child info related to another domain
(01:26:58 PM) Jim Fehlig: IMO, the domain private object should only contain info about its domain
(01:27:13 PM) Jim Fehlig: anyhow, something to think about :)
(01:27:18 PM) Jim Fehlig: have a good day

2, reply
(01:24:39 PM) Jim Fehlig: I don't really like the idea of having all the child info in the domain private object
the child info only record the pid of child for its own domain.
(01:25:17 PM) Jim Fehlig: there could be child info that has nothing to do with the domain private object right?
do u mean put child_info as a global variable?
i am not put the child_info as something like global variable because in that
case, libvirt need to remember pid and domain pair. And if the waitpid wait
the pid from other domain, it would lead to other ao_how_wait deadloop
because do not reaped the proper child with the proper ctx(remember such ctx is
domain ctx not the driver ctx, because we use the domain ctx for domain api
calls, e.g. create, save...)
(01:25:30 PM) Jim Fehlig: e.g. child info related to another domain
it will not. because each domain register its own libxl_childproc_setmode
function in libxlDomainObjPrivateInitCtx, so as to the libxl_fork_replacement
function. child_info in each libxlDomainObjPrivate only save the pid create
from its own libxl_fork_replacement.
