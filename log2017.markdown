It is hard for to focus on doing something. I could be pushed to work or discuss. But if no one ping me, I just waste my time.
PLAN and DO.
I could think randomly. But I could not focus.
I feel I am dying. I am suicide.

    8.  comment on bud17 slide: ask tlb hint internally.

2.  TODO
    1.  update STRIDE: 重点是coresight etr寄存器状态审计对于仿冒的防暑。dmss内存权限对于篡改的方式。考虑到打开kvm难度不大，建议审计时加入hyperviosr的HTBR和地址映射的审计(Secure EL3能否访问EL2). exception能不能被过滤?(如果确认了是exeption，可以问问mathieu能不能过滤).

1.  to yury:
    These patches look good to me. Just two comments:
    1.  19/20
        "Adjusted to move the move data page before code pages in sync with"
        should be
        "Adjusted to move the data page before code pages in sync with"?

    2.  I usually use "Bamvor Jian Zhang" instead of "Bamvor Zhang Jian" as my name. It'd better update them in 9/20, 12/20, 14/20, 15/20, 18/20, 19/20 to:
        Signed-off-by: Bamvor Jian Zhang <bamvor.zhangjian@linaro.org>

    And do you plan to test the performance of lmbench and specint? I bisected the performance in lmbench. I think the 1-2 difference is lead by is_comapt_thread and/or exception handler. What do you think about it?

2.  check the status in our 4.1 kernel

Sure. We assume that Linux is already rooted. So, the question is could
we find a trust area even if the kernel is rooted?

As you said, the REE could make use of public key. But I am thinking how
to avoid a re-use the same key to do a fake request. At the beginning, I
think I could use random key to avoid it. But if the random key is stored
in memory, then it could be geted through other CPU. So, I suppose the
random key should be only existed in cpu register. But the interrupt
is also need to take into account.

So, go back to my question, is there a best pratice for the transaction
between REE and TEE?

I think what we discussed is what I care.

Subject: mm: avoid setting up anonymous pages into file mapping

Reading page fault handler code I've noticed that under right
circumstances kernel would map anonymous pages into file mappings: if
the VMA doesn't have vm_ops->fault() and the VMA wasn't fully populated
on ->mmap(), kernel would handle page fault to not populated pte with
do_anonymous_page().

Let's change page fault handler to use do_anonymous_page() only on
anonymous VMA (->vm_ops == NULL) and make sure that the VMA is not
shared.

For file mappings without vm_ops->fault() or shred VMA without vm_ops,
page fault on pte_none() entry would lead to SIGBUS.
