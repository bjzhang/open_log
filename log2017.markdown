It is hard for to focus on doing something. I could be pushed to work or discuss. But if no one ping me, I just waste my time.
PLAN and DO.
I could think randomly. But I could not focus.
I feel I am dying. I am suicide.

    6.  align access.
        15:03-15:31 My colleague want to discuss unalignment access of aarch32: vstr. I think it will be an issue when migarte to arm64 kernel no mattter aarch32 or aarch64.

1.  today
    1.  每次都是这样，刚刚有一天稍稍认真的工作。马上就要晃悠。感觉自己好没有希望，过了14年，仍然受很差的生活规律困然。
    2.  本周重点工作：
        1.  dmss和海思讨论清楚。
        2.  bud17胶片，手稿。
        3.  出差准备：欧元。
    3.  10:45-11:08 rest.
    4.  read dmss register and set a non-security region.
        11:11-12:30 fail. I suspect dmss could not be read during boot.
        15:41-16:06 fail again.
        16:16-17:11
        17:35-18:19
    5.  12:30-15:00 加上吃饭，睡觉，醒觉一共用了两个半小时。有点长了。我觉得一共一个半小时比较好，也就是半小时吃饭，40分钟睡觉，20分钟醒觉。
    6.  PBC
        15:05-15:41
    7.  bud17 slide.
        18:21-18:25
    8.  下班: 21:55
    6.  read ILP32 patches.
    7.  check perf result.
    8.  comment on bud17 slide: ask tlb hint internally.

2.  TODO
    1.  update STRIDE: 重点是coresight etr寄存器状态审计对于仿冒的防暑。dmss内存权限对于篡改的方式。考虑到打开kvm难度不大，建议审计时加入hyperviosr的HTBR和地址映射的审计(Secure EL3能否访问EL2). exception能不能被过滤?(如果确认了是exeption，可以问问mathieu能不能过滤).

1.  to yury:
    These patches look good to me. Just two comments:
    1.  19/20
        "Adjusted to move the move data page before code pages in sync with"
        should be
        "Adjusted to move the data page before code pages in sync with"?

    2.  I usually use "Bamvor Jian Zhang" instead of "Bamvor Zhang Jian" as my name. It'd better update them in 9/20, 12/20, 14/20, 15/20, 18/20, 19/20 to:
        Signed-off-by: Bamvor Jian Zhang <bamvor.zhangjian@linaro.org>

    And do you plan to test the performance of lmbench and specint? I bisected the performance in lmbench. I think the 1-2 difference is lead by is_comapt_thread and/or exception handler. What do you think about it?

2.  check the status in our 4.1 kernel
    Subject: [PATCH 03/20] asm-generic: Drop getrlimit and setrlimit syscalls from default list
