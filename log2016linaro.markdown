Hi, Linux

I am re-writing the test in c language. When I do it, I found that the
script in c language is longer that bash script. What I do is as
follows:
1.  gpio-mockup.h
    1.  struct gpio_chip: define gpio_chip information for sysfs and
        chardev. It is *different* from such definition in kernel.
    2.  struct gpio_device: define function and value used by sysfs
        and chardev include the array of struct gpio_chip. Such array
        include information of gpio_chip attach to this gpio_device.

2.  gpio-mockup.c: main function with test framework and common
functions share with sysfs and chardev, user could select which
interface is used. Chardev will be default after it uptream. This file
includes:
    1.  struct gpio_testcase: testcases for testing.
    2.  main function for gpio test.
    3.  pin_get_debugfs: read pin status from debugfs which is used
        by both sysfs and chardev.

3.  gpio-mockup-sysfs.c: define and implement the function and
    variable defined by struct gpio_device.

4.  gpio-mockup-chardev.c: define and implement the function and
    variable defined by struct gpio_device.
    I do not if the utils of chardev(located in tools) will be a
    libray, if so, I could make use of the code to avoid duplicated
    code.

At the same time, I am thinking If I should wrote the test script in
shell and call the util of gpio chardev in the script.

Which one do you prefer?
1.  Full c languarges.
2.  Script for framework and sysfs, calling utils for chardev.

Hi, Linus

I am using this interface to do my gpio mockup test. I need to list
all the gpiochips attach to one gpio driver(aka gpio-mockup, there may
be more than one gpio drivers in the system). And then test some of the
pin of each gpio_chip.

From the api(ioctl GPIO_GET_CHIPINFO_IOCTL: gpiochip_info), it seems
that I could list all the gpiochips or list only one gpiochip. But
I could not list gpiochip belongs to one gpio driver.

Do I understand correctly?
Will we add a new api to do it?

Regards

Bamvor

> I think you can get that information from parsing sysfs?
Yeap, I could get the directory:
"/sys/devices/platform/gpio-mockup/gpio/"

I notice that you mark the sysfs ABI as obsolete in these series. I
am not sure whether it is reasonable to read it from syfs when using
chardev.

1.  kernel syscalls:
    1.  the base is include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h, it may support normal and optional compat syscall as follows `__SYSCALL(__NR_openat, sys_openat)`, `SC_COMP(__NR_openat, sys_openat, compat_sys_openat)`
        architecture could define it own unistd.h or overwrite the definition in it.
        E.g. for define the following two syscall as compat syscall.
        #define sys_openat             compat_sys_openat
        #define sys_open_by_handle_at  compat_sys_open_by_handle_at

2.  syscall wrapper

+ * Note: since the wrapper function will afterwards call a system call which

1.  cover letter
Add gpio test framework

These series of patches try to add support for testing of gpio
subsystem based on the proposal from Linus Walleij. The first version
is here[1].

The basic idea is implement a virtual gpio device(gpio-mockup) base
on gpiolib. Tester could test the gpiolib by manipulating gpio-mockup
device through sysfs or char device and check the result from debugfs.
Reference the following figure:

   sysfs/char device  debugfs
     |                   |
  gpiolib----------------/
     |
 gpio-mockup

Currently, this test script will use sysfs interface by default. I
plan set char device as default after it upstreamed.

In order to avoid conflict with other gpio exist in the system,
only dynamic allocation is tested by default. User could pass -f to
do full test.

[1] http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.gpio/11883

Changes since v1:
1.  Change value of gpio to boolean.
2.  Only test dynamic allocation by default.

2.  send them out:
`git send-email --no-chain-reply-to --annotate --to linux-gpio@vger.kernel.org --cc linus.walleij@linaro.org --cc broonie@kernel.org *.patch`

hikey, kernel, upstream

hikey upstream discussion between Guodong and Mark.

Of these only the clock, PSCI and the UART appear to be included in the
DTS.  If a feature is not enabled in the DTS most people would not
understand it as being supported upstream for the board since there is
no way for someone to actually use any of these features if they use
mainline.

It can boot to serial console with a ramdisk, nothing else.  There is a
serious discrepency between the features you are reporting as supported
upstream and the features that are actually supported upstream, the set
supported upstream is has not changed substantially since merge.

Again, this does not appear in the DT and is therefore unusable for
anyone using mainline.

This seems to already be in Linus' tree so unless some major problem is
discovered it should be in v4.5.

This does not appear to be part of the kernel development process, it
does not appear in -next and I can't see any prior cases where a pull
request from this tree has made it into -next.  I don't see that there
is any reasonable expectation that anything there will make it into
mainline.

Like I said above there is a big difference between what you are
reporting as upstream and the features that are practically usable
upstream.  This is creating a lot of frustration on the part of
potential users who want to work on mainline, both with the lack of
features itself and with the fact that lists of supported features are
typically substantially inaccurate which makes people feel they are
being mislead.
