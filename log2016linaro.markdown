Meeting with Mark
-----------------
1.  do not send activity recently.
2.  pending: y2038: ppdev and printer.
3.  pending: gpio: fix warning.
4.  pending: gpio: mockup.
5.  about THP in glibc. Mark suggest that:
    1.  Ask Ryan Arnold(team leader of Ryan).
    2.  Steve Capper(LEG). kernel guy. Familiar with THP and memory things.

1.  [ACTIVITY] (Bamvor Jian Zhang) 2016-01-11 to 2016-01-18
= Bamvor Jian Zhang=

=== Highlights ===
* Y2038
    - Send new version of parport device to LKML.

* 1:1 with Mark.

* GPIO:
    Try to re-write the gpiochip_add_to_list according to the suggestion
    from arnd.

* GPIO kselftest:
    Address the comment from maintainer.
    Re-write the gpio test script in c language.

* Kselftest improvement
    Support KBUILD_OUTPUT for kselftest
        There is no reply in LKML. Maybe I do not ask the right question.
        Will investigate it later.

=== Plans ===
* GPIO kselftest
Send out the new version of gpio mockup driver and testcases.

Hi, Linux

I am re-writing the test in c language. When I do it, I found that the
script in c language is longer that bash script. What I do is as
follows:
1.  gpio-mockup.h
    1.  struct gpio_chip: define gpio_chip information for sysfs and
        chardev. It is *different* from such definition in kernel.
    2.  struct gpio_device: define function and value used by sysfs
        and chardev include the array of struct gpio_chip. Such array
        include information of gpio_chip attach to this gpio_device.

2.  gpio-mockup.c: main function with test framework and common
functions share with sysfs and chardev, user could select which
interface is used. Chardev will be default after it uptream. This file
includes:
    1.  struct gpio_testcase: testcases for testing.
    2.  main function for gpio test.
    3.  pin_get_debugfs: read pin status from debugfs which is used
        by both sysfs and chardev.

3.  gpio-mockup-sysfs.c: define and implement the function and
    variable defined by struct gpio_device.

4.  gpio-mockup-chardev.c: define and implement the function and
    variable defined by struct gpio_device.
    I do not if the utils of chardev(located in tools) will be a
    libray, if so, I could make use of the code to avoid duplicated
    code.

At the same time, I am thinking If I should wrote the test script in
shell and call the util of gpio chardev in the script.

Which one do you prefer?
1.  Full c languarges.
2.  Script for framework and sysfs, calling utils for chardev.

Regards

Bamvor
