1.  Personal statement
I am looking for an opportunity which I could have a passion in it: Linux kernel, open source and ARM.

* I installed Linux in my computer when I am in high school which is the same year I get my first PC.
* I was curious about how does people port Linux to an architecture or a SOC in my graduate. And I finally get a chance to port Nucleus and Linux to our arm SOC 5 years ago.
* I fall in love with open source after I join SUSE in 2011.

All I want to say is that I am not an early bird, but working on Linux kernel and contributing to upstream is my passion.

BTW, I am interested in learning new language. I learned very basic words for German and Japanese from my friend.

    1.  Job title: Senior software engineer
    2.  Organizaiton: HUAWEI
    3.  Responsibilities
        1.  (From April): HUAWEI linaro assignee in kwg(Kernel working group).
            * Join the development for y2038, focus on the ioctl in driver code.
            * Bugfix for kselftest for arm and arm64. There are 7 patches under review in LKML.

        2.  Internal ILP32 maintainer for kernel and glibc.
            Develop the aarch64 ILP32 of kernel and glibc base on the very early patches from commnunity, fix handreds of failures in LTP test. Compare with the lastest community patches(kernel and glibc part is not upstream yet), there are **12** patches(bugfix) for kernel, glibc, LTP and buildroot in our git repo.

        3.  As a consultant, provide suggestion and troubleshooting for migration from old Linux kernel or arm 32bit hardware to lastest Linux on arm64 hardware, including kernel abi selection(aarch32, aarch64 ILP32, aarch64 LP64), kernel abi changes and update suggestion, glibc changes and suggestion.

        4.  Join openSUSE Asia Submit 2014 and give the presentation named "[openSUSE on ARM](https://github.com/openSUSE-CN/oSA2014-slides/blob/master/Bamvor_Jian_Zhang-openSUSE_on_Arm.pdf)"
    4.  Explanation
        I like the work in here(Linux kernel, arm, open source), But too many hours to work(ten hours per day in three month). It is hard to work here in long time.

2.  SUSE(01/2011-07/2014):

        2.  Play openSUSE on my arm board in hackweek and my spare time. Our opensuse arm team got an reward in hackweek.
            The first person port cubietruck(Cortex-A7 powered SOC) to [xen](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_ARM_with_Virtualization_Extensions/Allwinner).
        3.  Totally 11 patches got accept.
    4.  Explanation
        Want to look for the job which could focus on Linux kernel
