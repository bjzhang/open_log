1.  Personal statement
I am looking for an opportunity which I could have a passion in it: Linux kernel, open source and ARM.

* I installed Linux in my computer when I am in high school which is the same year I get my first PC.
* I was curious about how does people port Linux to an architecture or a SOC in my graduate. And I finally get a chance to port Nucleus and Linux to our arm SOC 5 years ago.
* I fall in love with open source after I join SUSE in 2011.

All I want to say is that I am not an early bird, but working on Linux kernel and contributing to upstream is my passion.

BTW, I am interested in learning new language. I learned very basic words for German and Japanese from my friend.

    1.  Job title: Senior software engineer
    2.  Organizaiton: HUAWEI
    3.  Responsibilities

1.  recommandation letter.
Hi Axel,
I trust everything is going great over there. I miss OpenSynergy and Berlin a lot but I'm very happy to be back with my family.

My friend Bamvor Zhang wants to move to Germany from Beijing and I thought he can be a great addition to your team. He has several years of experience with ARM, the Linux kernel and Xen, having worked porting them to different SoCs. He has also been very active in open source communities. His English is quite good, he is friendly, and he loves what he does.

You can find a short CV from him in https://careers.stackoverflow.com/bamvor and his mail address is <bamv2005@gmail.com>

best regards,
Alejandro Mery

1.  cover letter for opensynergy
Dear Manager

I am very excited to hear of your available Software Engineer â€“ Embedded Linux (f/m) position, and formally submit my resume for consideration.

I work on Linux, arm and virtualization more than 7 years after I got Master Degree.

I installed Linux in my computer when I am in high school which is the same year I get my first PC. I was curious about how does people port Linux to an architecture or a SOC in university. And I finally get a chance to port Nucleus and Linux to our arm SOC 5 years ago. I am definitely not an early bird, but working on Linux kernel is my passion.

When I work for vimicro, I take the responsibility for verifying the arm processor(not SOC) and upgrade our development environment from arm 9 to Cortex-A8. Thanks to this opportunity, I got plenty of time to dig into the arm architecture, debug tools and arm SOC. I also write assembly code for initialization the soc or finding out the failure of the soc. With the deep knowledge of arm and SOC, life is eaiser to understand the device driver and virtualization things.

I learn differenct part of Linux kernel, including memory management, architecture relative code, device driver and so on.

I experience in virtualization area(hypervisor and tools) more than two years.

BTW, I am interested in learning new language. I learned very basic words for German and Japanese from my friends.

Salary expertation: First of all, the opportunity is more important than the salary. My current package is 400k RMB per year(20000 x 12 month plus 8 month bonus). If this job is in China, I would say that I want roughly 30% more salary. But I have no idea the salary in Germany. Basically, I want to move the Germany because I hope we could work-life-balance: My wife will not work in Germany(My second daughter is 7 month at this moment).

I could on boarding one month later(for resigning from HUAWEI) after I got the offer and visa.

BTW: I have sent them in the website, but no response on website nor email. So, I send them again. Sorry for inconvenience.

2.  resume for opensynergy
You have completed a BS or MS in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering or in a related field
You have experience in the development of embedded software and development of operating systems
Excellent programming skills in C/C++ and optionally low-level assembly programming, especially on the ARM architecture
You understand the overall architecture of the Linux Kernel and have already done kernel-level programming in Linux or comparable operating systems
We are specifically interested in candidates who have additional experience in virtualization technologies
You are familiar with professional software development processes and tools
You are able to develop creative solutions for complex software problems
You feel happy in a cooperatively managed team environment
You have a good command of English (for technical work) and at least basic German (for day to day interaction)
You are goal-oriented and can work independently but are ready to adjust quickly to the demands of our customers.

1.  In Huawei
    I focus on the features we need when we migratie from the old arm32 with old kernel(2.6.x or 3.x) to the our lastest stable kernel(4.x). E.g. ILP32 on aarch64, binary compatability when upgrade the kernel and glibc.

2.  In Vimicro
    The main of issue of the project we encountered is we upgraded the cpu from arm9 to Cortex-A8.

Hi, Vincent

This is Jian Zhang. Thanks for your time to interview me in Beijing 5 years ago. It is a pitty I could not take the offer from nvidia in 2010. Meanwhile, I still work on Linux kernel relative area in recently years.

Recently, I am looking for opportunity to move to Germany with my family. In brief, this is a family decision. We got very positive information from my colleague in Nuremberg who move to Germany in last year and my classmate who graduate in Dresden. If I could move to Germany, I could focus on technology and my wife will take care of our two daughters. It is family work-life balance, right?

I found a position in Munich posted by nvidia: "SENIOR SYSTEM SOFTWARE ENGINEER"(https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/76630845?trk=vsrp_jobs_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A1322051471445003805296%2CVSRPtargetId%3A76630845%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary). I want to re-introduce myself and explain why I am a good candidate for this position. It would be great if you could do me a favor to introduce me to nvidia.

First of all, I feel the innovation in nvidia is very cool. From 4+1 processor in soc to the denver architecture, from powerful gpu to nVidia shield, I am sure that I could touch lots of interesting and innovation things if I could join nvidia.

Here is JD requirement and my key experience(You could find my full experience in my linkedin profile):
1.  A good degree from a leading university in an engineering or computer science related discipline, with significant industry experience.
Mine:
    I work on Linux, arm and embedded more than 7 years after I got Master Degree(major in embedded software).

2.  Good understanding of low level software drivers and kernel.
Mine:
    Deep knowledge of arm architecture in both 32bit and 64bit.
    Experience in nucleus and Linux kernel porting for new arm powered soc.
    Experience in several drivers, such as v4l2, sd card, power management and so on.
    Internal aarch64 ILP32 maintainer for kernel and glibc in huawei.

3.  Familiar with embedded platforms and system software.
Mine:
    Join allwinner (ARM powered) soc community, the first person port xen to cortex-A7 SOC with serial and networking enabled.

4.  Ability to debug at board and chip level and comfortable probing hardware.
Mine:
    Familar with both JTAG and SW as well as coresight infrastructure. Fix more than 2 bugs through different coresight control path.
    Fmailar with oscilloscope and logic analyzer.

5.  Good understanding of Linux and/or QNX operating system.
Mine:
    openSUSE for my daily work.

6.  Good communication and organisation skills, with a logical approach to problem solving, good time management and task prioritisation.
Mine:
    Support about 100 engineer with different issue or bug in the same project in vimicro.

7.  Proactive and able to work with a minimum of supervision.
Mine:
    This is very similar to what happened in suse.

BTW:
1.  I am interested in learning new language. I learned very basic words for German from my friends.
2.  As an assignee from Huawei, I came to San Francisco early this month. It is a pity not talk with you face to face.
3.  I could send you my resume if needed.

I am appreciate you time and looking forward to your reply.

Best regards

Bamvor
