word, pain, 常見英文錯誤: painful 的誤用
http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/teacher-sammy/article?mid=-2&prev=885&l=a&fid=36
各位會怎麼翻譯 "我很痛苦" 這句很簡單的話呢?
大部份的人可能會說: I am very painful.
因為各位一直在學 painful 這個字的時候, 它就叫 "痛苦的"
但是把 "我很痛苦" 譯為 I am painful.  也是個錯誤的句子哦!!
我們又再一次地被過份簡化的英漢字典或英文書給害了...
事實上, painful  的意思應該是 "令人感到痛苦的"
所以我們只能說某個事物是 painful  的
像 a painful experience, a painful process 等
不能說一個人是 painful 的
即使一個人給別人造成痛苦, 也不會用 painful
而會說此人 "是一個 pain"
比如: My boss is a pain. (我的老板真討人厭)
再強烈一點的話, 可以說某人是 a pain in the neck  (脖子上的痛處, 較文雅)
但口語中也常說  a pain in the ass  (屁股上的痛處, 較粗俗但常用)
來造個句: Ray is a real pain in the ass.  (Ray 這個人真的很難搞)
"我很痛苦" 的正確說法是: I am / was  in (a lot of / great) pain.
人感到痛苦是用 be in pain  這個片語
要表示 "很通苦" 的話, 就可以在 pain  前面加 a lot of, great, a great deal of  等
比如: Tim was in a lot of pain for a week after his surgery.
最後, pain  居然也可以當動詞的, 意思是 "使...感到痛苦"
比如: It pained me to watch my dog die.
所以, 如果沒有把一個字的意思徹底搞懂, 就用中文去直譯英文的話
是會錯誤百出, 鬧很多笑話的
下次再碰到中文裡意思一樣的兩個英文字
或是想知道這個字到底在英文裡的意思和中文對這個字的翻譯有沒有一樣時
可以去查閱英英字典, 看一下英文的解釋是什麼
當然這要程度還不錯的同學才看得懂英英字典
程度還沒那麼好的同學, 就多來看我的部落格吧!
