1, disk image lock
copy from https://fate.suse.com/313599
The virtual machine lock manager is a daemon which will ensure that a virtual machine's disk image cannot be written to by two QEMU/KVM processes at the same time. It provides protection against starting the same virtual machine twice, or adding the same disk to two different virtual machines. From our point view, this feature is a must to have in every production environment.

To enable this functionality the following packages are needed: kvm, qemu, libvirt and sanlock. According to the sles11 sp2 Release Notes http://www.novell.com/linux/releasenotes/x86_64/SUSE-SLES/11-SP2/ SANLOCK is not part of it. It would be very helpfull to include this sanlock into Sles11 SP2. To make make sure sanlock is working, libvirt must be updated version 0.9.9 (planned version 0.9.6) btw. sanlock is already available for RHEL6 Additional information: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/VirtLockManager http://libvirt.org/locking.html

Avaya is switching from RH to SLES because we support Xen. This revenue stream is approx 400,000USD per year.

Hi, Bamvor, 

I've read your lock patch and qemu lock functions. I have some questions: 
1. Our lock patch functions are all similar to qemu functions, I think it should be OK since qemu is working. Some other functions in qemu but not in libxl like qemuDomainObjRestoreJob(). (will never used in libxl?) 
2. This is the first time I'm digging in the job series code, seems the benefit of these functions is only to coordinate different jobs (when we try to do a job, it will check if there are other jobs doing and check if this job can be co-working with those jobs), right? 
But "virsh list" doesn't use the job code, so live migration and "virsh list" co-working problem could not be solved by this lock mechanism. Its migration code lock driver and vm at the perform phase, and virsh list too, I doubt qemu can be virsh list and migration same time? Never tested. 

Thanks, 
Chunyan

yes, i think so.

the RestoreJob will be used in libxl if i want to recover job in the libxlReconnectDomain. but i guess it is not very important for now.

yes. coordinate the api which maybe change the vm state.

yes, because the "virsh list" only query the state, there is no need to protect. so do the qemu.

i test and it work.

suse, release notes
"Karl Eichwalder <ke@suse.de>"_email_"[Research] Providing SLE 11 SP3 Release Notes"_20121011_1541
Here are some notes how you can help with the Release Notes.

Technical Background Info
=========================

Since SLE 11 SP2 we mostly create and maintain release notes entries in
FATE.  The "Editor" tab features an "Release Notes" sub-tab, where you
are expected to write the text: just Title, Challenge (optional), and
Solution.

Then select a "ReleaseNotes" category from the "Internal" sub-tab.  As
long as there is no ReleaseNotes category assigned, the entry does not
appear in the final release notes document.

We have FATE export scripts (written by Jürgen Weigert and Thomas
Schraitle) that merge FATE entries that are set to "Done", into the
traditional docbook document.  From the docbook document we create the
output format for yast, html, and pdf using the standard docbook xsl
style-sheets.

Thus far, in https://svn.suse.de/svn/doc/trunk we have

release-notes-sdk/
release-notes-sled/
release-notes-sles/         (also used for sles-for-vmware)
release-notes-suse-cloud/


Writing Texts
=============

Everybody is encouraged to help with writing such texts (drafts).  In
the end, the so-called stakeholders are responsible for providing the
texts.  Stakeholders are our partners (IBM is already pretty good with
providing input for their features), project and engineering managers,
and the developer.  Often even the product manager will lend a helping
hand in one or the other way ;)

If you do not feel comfortable with writing draft texts in the release
notes tab, at least try to summarize the implemented feature somehow and
either add this summary as a regular comment or add it to the
"Documentation Impact" field in the "Misc" sub-tab.

The assigned documentation editor (that's mostly me these days) cannot
wade through all the comments of a feature and write the release notes
snippets on his own.  I often simply do not actually understand what a
certain feature might be about, or it would take too much time to study
the long list of comments to get a clue about it.  Thus your help is
very much needed!


Challenges
==========

Some features apply for more than one SP and we will update the SP2
release notes document in parallel with the SP3 document for several
months.  This means you must write the entry in a way that it fits for
both SPs.

Release notes categories are often unclear.  If in doubt, select
ReleaseNotes:Features:Other (or, once available, ReleaseNotes:Misc).


Discussion
==========

This is how it looks to me.  I'd like to hear comments, either "in
general" or about some details.  Matthias, Gerald, or Jürgen, please add
what is needed!

2, commit log
1), Introduce a lock for libxl long-running api
This patch introduce a lock for protecting the long-running
api (save, dump, migration and so on) from the other api
which may update the status of the virtual machine. 

Signed-off-by: Bamvor Jian Zhang <bjzhang@suse.com>

2), Add lock for libxl api

Add long-running jobs for save, dump. Add normal job for the
api maybe modify the domain.
