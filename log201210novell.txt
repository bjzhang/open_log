copy from https://fate.suse.com/313599
The virtual machine lock manager is a daemon which will ensure that a virtual machine's disk image cannot be written to by two QEMU/KVM processes at the same time. It provides protection against starting the same virtual machine twice, or adding the same disk to two different virtual machines. From our point view, this feature is a must to have in every production environment.

To enable this functionality the following packages are needed: kvm, qemu, libvirt and sanlock. According to the sles11 sp2 Release Notes http://www.novell.com/linux/releasenotes/x86_64/SUSE-SLES/11-SP2/ SANLOCK is not part of it. It would be very helpfull to include this sanlock into Sles11 SP2. To make make sure sanlock is working, libvirt must be updated version 0.9.9 (planned version 0.9.6) btw. sanlock is already available for RHEL6 Additional information: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/VirtLockManager http://libvirt.org/locking.html
