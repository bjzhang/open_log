在米兰的一个“儿童之家”，女教员在窗户下做了一个狭长的架子，上面摆放着图画课用的金属几何模型。但是这个架子太窄了，孩子们在选择模型时，常常掀翻小桌子，桌上的金属模型也被摔得砰砰地响。女教员打算让木匠把架子加宽，但是木匠迟迟不来。就在等待木匠的那段时间里，她发现孩子们已经学会小心去取用这些模型，小桌子和模型再也没有被掀翻和碰落。

感觉训练的另一个重要技术是“感觉隔离”。例如，训练听觉应该在安静而黑暗的环境中进行，这样才能取得更好的效果。对触觉、温度感觉、压力感觉和立体感觉等一般感觉的训练，都应该把孩子的眼睛蒙起来进行。这种情况下可以提高孩子的兴趣，并使注意力集中到进行的感觉刺激上，而不被嬉闹玩笑分散。

Some functions (examples would include schedule(), do_wait(), or irq_thread()) are always running somewhere in the kernel, so kpatch cannot be used to apply a patch that modifies them. On a typical system, there will probably be a few dozen functions that can block a live patch in this way — a pretty small subset of the thousands of functions in the kernel.

在孩子成长过程中，存在一个自我完善期。在这个时期，孩子将获得某种动作的永久性能力。之前，成长有三个阶段：第一，潜意识阶段。在孩子混乱的头脑中，一切的行为都由一种神秘的内部冲动控制。由于不属于意识行为，他们不能够随心所欲地进行重复练习。第二阶段，意识阶段。这时的行为活动具备意识。第三，意识反应阶段。孩子能够通过意志的指引动作来对他人的命令做出回应。

While individual applications cannot change their own endianness, an Operating System can host both big-endian and little-endian applications.  There is a greater range of preload hint instructions. These allow preload for load and for store as well as providing hints about whether preloaded data should be cached or not.  A pair of “one-way” barrier instructions, Load-Acquire (LDAR) and Store-Release (STLR), offer greater flexibility than the DMB/DSB. There is an example shown in the Assembly Code section below.  Strongly-Ordered memory is not supported in AArch64 (it was deprecated in ARMv7-A) and Device memory has acquired some extra features to make it more flexible (the ability to define separate restrictions for Gathering, Re-ordering and Early Write Acknowledgement). Changing Execution state and Instruction set A fully-populated ARMv8-A processor supports both AArch32 and Aarch64 execution states. Transition between the two is always across an exception boundary. This differs from ARMv7-A in which a change of instruction set is triggered by an interworking branch (e.g.BLX).

A fully-populated ARMv8-A processor supports both AArch32 and Aarch64 execution states. Transition between the two is always across an exception boundary. This differs from ARMv7-A in which a change of instruction set is triggered by an interworking branch (e.g.BLX). The

The AArch64 register bank is mapped in a fixed way to the AArch32 registers allowing 64-bit code access to all the user and privileged registers available to 32-bit code. This allows, for instance, a 64-bit operating system or hypervisor to perform a complete context save for a 32-bit process or guest OS

ILP32 (a variant which can ease porting 32-bit software which doesn’t need 64-bit addressing and can also improve performance of applications which use a lot of pointers but do not require 64-bit addressing). When compiling for ARMv7-A, you will most likely have used a data model equivalent to what is shown as ILP32 in the table.

Note that it is still possible to branch in some circumstances by copying an address directly to the Program Counter.However, the RET instruction provides an explicit hint to the processor that the branch is a function return - this can improve branch prediction (using a return stack) considerably

The Platform Register (PR) is reserved for specific use by particular ABIs and allocators should not use it for any other purpose. If a PR is not required on a particular platform, it may be used as a scratch register but such code will not necessarily be portable to other platforms.X19-X28 are designated as callee-saved and must therefore be preserved by a function call. The Frame Pointer (X29) is used for linking stack frames

As long as your code has used pointers in a portable way (e.g. you have never stored a pointer in an int variable and have never cast a pointer to a int or vice versa, for instance), the main thing to note is that sizeof(int) != sizeof(long). Among other effects, this will change the size, and possibly the alignment, of structures an parameter lists. You should take care to use the int32_t and int64_t types from stdint.h in cases where storage length matters. Note also that size_t and ssize_t are both long (64-bit) in A64-LP64. Although it may seem that pointers may be stored in “long” variables, you should use types like intptr_t for maximum portability and safety

Timing information has been provided in the past for some ARM processors to assist in the hand tuning of performance critical code sequences or in the development of an instruction scheduler within a compiler. This timing information is not required for producing optimized instruction sequences on the Cortex-A57 MPCore multiprocessor. The out-of-order pipeline of the multiprocessor can schedule and execute the instructions in an optimal fashion without any instruction reordering required

Depending on the size of the L2 cache, the L2 cache reset can take 640 CLK cycles for a 512KB L2 cache or 2560 CLK cycles for a 2MB L2 cache. The L2 cache reset occurs in the background, in parallel with the L1 cache resets. The processor can begin execution in Non-cacheable state, but any attempt to perform Cacheable transactions stalls the processor until the appropriate cache reset is complete
