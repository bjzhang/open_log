在米兰的一个“儿童之家”，女教员在窗户下做了一个狭长的架子，上面摆放着图画课用的金属几何模型。但是这个架子太窄了，孩子们在选择模型时，常常掀翻小桌子，桌上的金属模型也被摔得砰砰地响。女教员打算让木匠把架子加宽，但是木匠迟迟不来。就在等待木匠的那段时间里，她发现孩子们已经学会小心去取用这些模型，小桌子和模型再也没有被掀翻和碰落。

感觉训练的另一个重要技术是“感觉隔离”。例如，训练听觉应该在安静而黑暗的环境中进行，这样才能取得更好的效果。对触觉、温度感觉、压力感觉和立体感觉等一般感觉的训练，都应该把孩子的眼睛蒙起来进行。这种情况下可以提高孩子的兴趣，并使注意力集中到进行的感觉刺激上，而不被嬉闹玩笑分散。

Some functions (examples would include schedule(), do_wait(), or irq_thread()) are always running somewhere in the kernel, so kpatch cannot be used to apply a patch that modifies them. On a typical system, there will probably be a few dozen functions that can block a live patch in this way — a pretty small subset of the thousands of functions in the kernel.

在孩子成长过程中，存在一个自我完善期。在这个时期，孩子将获得某种动作的永久性能力。之前，成长有三个阶段：第一，潜意识阶段。在孩子混乱的头脑中，一切的行为都由一种神秘的内部冲动控制。由于不属于意识行为，他们不能够随心所欲地进行重复练习。第二阶段，意识阶段。这时的行为活动具备意识。第三，意识反应阶段。孩子能够通过意志的指引动作来对他人的命令做出回应。

While individual applications cannot change their own endianness, an Operating System can host both big-endian and little-endian applications.  There is a greater range of preload hint instructions. These allow preload for load and for store as well as providing hints about whether preloaded data should be cached or not.  A pair of “one-way” barrier instructions, Load-Acquire (LDAR) and Store-Release (STLR), offer greater flexibility than the DMB/DSB. There is an example shown in the Assembly Code section below.  Strongly-Ordered memory is not supported in AArch64 (it was deprecated in ARMv7-A) and Device memory has acquired some extra features to make it more flexible (the ability to define separate restrictions for Gathering, Re-ordering and Early Write Acknowledgement). Changing Execution state and Instruction set A fully-populated ARMv8-A processor supports both AArch32 and Aarch64 execution states. Transition between the two is always across an exception boundary. This differs from ARMv7-A in which a change of instruction set is triggered by an interworking branch (e.g.BLX).

The AArch64 register bank is mapped in a fixed way to the AArch32 registers allowing 64-bit code access to all the user and privileged registers available to 32-bit code. This allows, for instance, a 64-bit operating system or hypervisor to perform a complete context save for a 32-bit process or guest OS

As long as your code has used pointers in a portable way (e.g. you have never stored a pointer in an int variable and have never cast a pointer to a int or vice versa, for instance), the main thing to note is that sizeof(int) != sizeof(long). Among other effects, this will change the size, and possibly the alignment, of structures an parameter lists. You should take care to use the int32_t and int64_t types from stdint.h in cases where storage length matters. Note also that size_t and ssize_t are both long (64-bit) in A64-LP64. Although it may seem that pointers may be stored in “long” variables, you should use types like intptr_t for maximum portability and safety

Functional Description 5. The SoC can then choose to deassert the CLKEN input to the multiprocessor to stop all remaining internal clocks within the processor that are derived from CLK. All clocks in the shared L2 memory system logic, GIC, and Timer, are disabled. If CLKEN is deasserted, the SoC must assert the CLKEN input on a WFI wake-up event to enable the L2 memory system and potentially the processor. There are two classes of wake-up events: • An event that requires only the L2 memory system to be enabled. • An event that requires both the L2 memory and the processor to be enabled. The following wake-up events cause both the L2 memory system and the processor to exit WFI low-power state: • A physical IRQ or FIQ interrupt. • A debug event. • Powerup or Warm reset. The following wake-up events cause only the L2 memory system to exit WFI low-power state: • If the device is configured to have an ACE interface, deassertion of ACINACTM to service an external snoop request on the AXI master snoop interface. • If the device is configured to have a CHI interface: — Deassertion of SINACT to service an external snoop request. — Activation of TX or RX links. • Deassertion of AINACTS to service an ACP transaction on the slave interface. When the processor exits from WFI low-power state STANDBYWFI for that processor is deasserted. When the L2 memory system logic exits from WFI low-power state, STANDBYWFIL2 is deasserted.

You can use the SMPEN output to differentiate between a retention and powerdown opportunity.However, this is not a requirement and this communication might occur because of other methods such as message passing between the processor and external power controller. If SMPEN is HIGH, the processor is still in coherency with the other processors in the multiprocessor and therefore only retention is appropriate. If SMPEN is LOW it indicates the processor can be powered down. If the SMPEN is sampled LOW when the CPU Q-Channel handshake has completed the transition to retention, the processor can be returned to the active state using the Q-Channel, then if CPUQACTIVE is still LOW, the power controller can start a powerdown transition of the processor

Key differences between the AArch64 and AArch32 address translation systems are that the AArch64 state provides the ability to: • Select the translation granule to either be 4KB or 64KB. In AArch32, the translation granule is limited to be 4KB. • Configure the ASID size to be either 8-bit or 16-bit. In AArch32, the ASID is limited to an 8-bit value. The maximum supported physical address size is: • 44-bit in AArch64 state. • 40-bit in AArch32 state.

Misses from the L1 instruction and data TLBs are handled by a unified L2 TLB. This is a 1024-entry 4-way set-associative structure. The L2 TLB supports the page sizes of 4K, 64K, 1MB and 16MB. It also supports page sizes of 2MB and 1GB for the long descriptor format translation in AArch32 state and in AArch64 state when using the 4KB translation granule. In addition, the L2 TLB supports the 512MB page map size defined for the AArch64 translations that use a 64KB translation granule. Accesses to the L2 TLB take a variable number of cycles, based on the competing requests from each of the L1 TLBs, TLB maintenance operations in flight, and the different page size mappings in use

[PATCH v3] add support for libvirt-like channels David Scott • 06/24 01:28 Hi,Ian C -- I've tried to fix up everything you've highlighted. Let meknow if there's something I missed or misunderstood!On hotplug/unplug: this patch set does not include hotplug or unplug. I'vegot an early prototype of this but it's more complicated than I'd likebecause it needs to manage qemu chardevs via qmp messages.Note that hotplug and unplug are not needed by the libvirt use-case,so I think the best thing to do is to use (static) qemu backends fornow and then fill in the gaps in xenconsoled later and switch over.The blurb:Several libvirt applications (e.g. oVirt, CloudStack) make use of 'channels': low-bandwidth private host <-> guest communication links which resemble serial ports. Typical uses include: * initial VM configuration without using the network: read the config data directly from the channel on boot * controlling a guest agent: signal shutdown reqests, exchange clipboard data, trigger resolution changes This patch set re-uses the existing PV console protocol implemented by qemu to provide this service. If you declare a channel in your .xl file as follows: channel = [ "type=socket,path=/tmp/mysock,name=guest-agent" ] then an extra PV console will be added to your guest. This console has the extra key in the frontend name = guest-agent which allows udev scripts in the VM to create a named device in a well-known location (e.g. /dev/xen-channels/guest-agent, similar to the KVM /dev/vports). The qemu process in the backend domain will proxy the data to/from the named Unix domain socket (in this case /tmp/mysock). Note this mechanism is intended for low-bandwidth communication only. If an application requires a high-bandwith connection then it should use a direct vchan connection (and not proxy it via a qemu). Changes since v2:* trim down the 'kinds' of channels to PTY and SOCKET -- these seem the most  useful and we can add more later* add a channelinfo (queryable by 'channel-list') to check the state of each  channel, and for a kind=PTY discover the slave device path* IDL: switched to KeyedUnion for both the channel and channelinfo since  each 'kind' will have different parameters (e.g. only SOCKET has PATH)* write all the backend configuration parameters to xenstore -- where we were  using qemu -chardev some crucial information was only on the command-line.* add LIBXL_HAVE_DEVICE_CHANNEL* docs: replace 'should' with 'will' e.g. the backend will be connected to  a Unix domain socket* squash all the libxl patches together into a coherent whole* explain that there is no registry of channel names and so people should use  unique information to create them (e.g. include domain name and interface  version)Changes since v1: * extend xl.cfg(5) * add docs/misc/channel.txt * libxl_types.idl: omit unnecessary init_val = 0 * xl_cmdimpl.c: fixed over-long lines * xl_cmdimpl.c: use xrealloc (via ARRAY_EXTEND_INIT) * xl_cmdimpl.c: exit() on parse failure rather than ignore configuration * libxl_create.c: use libxl__device_console_init instead of memset * libxl_create.c: use libxl__strdup(NOGC rather than raw strdup * libxl.c: add name=<name> to console frontend * libxl.c: resolve the backend_domid from backend_domname * libxl_dm.c: channels[i].devid rather than i * libxl_dm.c: fix indentation * libxl_dm.c: use GCSPRINTF convenience macro Signed-off-by: David Scott <dave.scott< at >citrix.com> 源地址 http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.xen.devel/204461 发送至：印象笔记

[RFC PATCH 0/9] ARM: Forwarding physical interrupts to a guest VM Marc Zyngier • 06/26 02:28 The GIC architecture (ARM's Generic Interrupt Controller) allows anactive physical interrupt to be forwarded to a guest, and the guest toindirectly perform the deactivation of the interrupt by performing anEOI on the virtual interrupt (see for example the GICv2 spec, 3.2.1).So far, Linux doesn't have this notion, which is a bit of a pain.This patch series introduce two generic features:- A way to mark an interrupt as "forwarded": this allows an irq_chip  to know that it shouldn't perform the deactivation itself- A way to save/restore the "state" of a "forwarded" interrupt

As an example of how this feature might be used, consider the Linux page cache, which maintains copies of pages from disk files. When memory gets tight, the page cache will start forgetting pages which are clean, but which have not been referenced in the recent past. With transcendental memory, the page cache could, before dropping the pages, attempt to store them into an ephemeral transcendental memory pool. At some future time, when one of those pages is needed again, the page cache would first attempt to fetch it from the pool. If the tmem_get_page() call succeeds, a disk I/O operation will have been avoided and everybody benefits; otherwise the page is read from disk as usual.

Persistent (non-ephemeral) pools could be used as a sort of swap device. If the swapping code succeeds in writing a page to the pool, it can avoid writing it to the real swap device. The result is saved I/O at both swap-out and swap-in times. If the pool lacks space for the swapped page, it will be written to the real swap device in the usual way.

the transcendental memory implementation can try to optimize its management of the memory pools. Guests which are more active (or which have been given a higher priority) might be allowed to allocate more pages from the pools. Duplicate pages can be coalesced; KSM-like techniques could be used, but the use of object IDs could make it easier to detect duplicates in a number of situations.

If pool creation is successful, tmem provides a "pool id". Handles are unique within pools, not across pools, and consist of a 192-bit "object id" and a 32-bit "index." The rough equivalent of an object is a "file" and the index is the rough equivalent of a page offset into the file.

Note that, unlike I/O, the copying performed by tmem is fully synchronous. As a result, arbitrary locks can (and, to avoid races, often should!) be held by the caller.

The kernel is responsible for maintaining coherency between tmem and the kernel's own data, and tmem has two types of "lush" operations to assist with this: To disassociate a handle from any tmem data, the kernel uses a "flush" operation. To disassociate all chunks of data in an object, the kernel uses a "flush object" operation. After a flush, subsequent gets will fail. A get on an (unshared) ephemeral pool is destructive, i.e. implies a flush; otherwise, the get is non-destructive and an explicit flush is required.

Another example is if tmem is compressing data as it does in zcache and it determines that the compressed page of data is too large; in this case, tmem might reject any page that isn't sufficiently compressible OR perhaps even if the mean compression ratio is growing unacceptably.

Although a tmem backend might seem similar to a block device, it does not perform I/O and does not use the block I/O (bio) subsystem. In fact, a tmem backend must perform its functions fully synchronously, that is, it must not sleep and the scheduler may not be called.

When pages are put to RAMster-POC, they are first compressed and cached locally using a zcache-like tmem backend. As local memory constraints increase, an asynchronous process attempts to "remotify" pages to another cluster node; if one node rejects the attempt, another node can be used as long as the local node tracks where the remote data resides. Although the current RAMster-POC doesn't implement this, one could even remotify multiple copies to achieve higher availability (i.e. to recover from node failures).

While this multi-level mechanism in RAMster works nicely for puts, there is currently no counterpart for gets. When a tmem frontend requests a persistent get, the data must be fetched immediately and synchronously; the thread requiring the data must busy-wait for the data to arrive and the scheduler must not be called. As a result current RAMster-POC is best suited for many-core processors, where it is unusual for all cores to be simultaneously active.

it may make sense for those pages to reside in tmem instead of in the guest. To achieve this, Xen implements aggressive "self-ballooning", which artificially creates memory pressure by driving the Xen balloon driver to claim page frames, thus forcing the kernel to reclaim pages, which sends them to tmem.

The algorithm essentially uses control theory to drive towards a memory target that approximates the current "working set" of the workload using the "Committed_AS" kernel variable. Since Committed_AS does't account for clean, mapped pages, these pages end up residing in Xen tmem where, queueing theory assures us, Xen can manage the pages more efficiently.

Huge paes must be swappable, lest the system run out of memory in a hurry. Rather than complicate the swapping code with an understanding of huge pages, Andrea simply splits a huge page back into its component small pages if that page needs to be reclaimed. Many other operations (mprotect(), mlock(), ...) will also result in the splitting of a page.

System administrators have a number of knobs that they can tweak, all found under /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage. The enabled value can be set to "always" (to always use THP), "madvise" (to use huge pages only in VMAs marked with MADV_HUGEPAGE), or "never" (to disable the feature). Another knob, defrag, takes the same values; it controls whether the kernel should make aggressive use of memory compaction to make more huge pages available.
