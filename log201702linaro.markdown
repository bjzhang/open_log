    1.  cont page hint
        1.  track page allocation in vma.
            11:26-11:54 It seems that I could trace vma in vma allocation(aka: kmem_cache_zalloc) and _vma_adjust. I do not need to care the details of _vma_adjust.
            14:35-15:16 Could not focus.
            15:16- read all the vma allocate and free code, if it is ok. write the code.
