a short message to remind you that the content of the release notes/doc should
came from PrjMgr, PM and engineers. Try to keep our Doc/RN synchronise
and up to date is really important and is the best way to have a good product.
The team has spent time to work on features, improvements, bug fixes for
SP3, this should be visisble outside.

Thanks in advance to take care of your fate, and see if you can help in

kernel, release, 3.8, f2fs
Summary: f2fs is a new filesystem for FTL enabled device, such as SSDs, eMMC, SD cards,
https://lwn.net/Articles/518988/
f2fs (interestingly not "f3s") is the "flash-friendly file system", a new filesystem for Linux recently announced by engineers from Samsung. Unlike jffs2 and logfs, f2fs is not targeted at raw flash devices, but rather at the specific hardware that is commonly available to consumers — SSDs, eMMC, SD cards, and other flash storage with an FTL (flash translation layer) already built in. It seems that as hardware gets smarter, we need to make even more clever software to manage that "smartness". Does this sound like parenting to anyone else?

f2fs is based on the log-structured filesystem (LFS) design — which is hardly surprising given the close match between the log-structuring approach and the needs of flash. For those not familiar with log-structured design, the key elements are:

    That it requires copy-on-write, so data is always written to previously unused space.

    That free space is managed in large regions which are written to sequentially. When the number of free regions gets low, data that is still live is coalesced from several regions into one free region, thus creating more free regions. This process is known as "cleaning" and the overhead it causes is one of the significant costs of log structuring.

virtualization, xen, move from hv to git; hg to git flow
"Ian Jackson <Ian.Jackson@xxxxxxxxxxxxx>"_email_"[Xen-devel] Moving xen*.hg to git"_20130213_1708
As previously agreed, we will be moving the main Xen trees to git.
The existing .hg trees will continue to exist, but as hg mirrors of
the git history.  Committers will push to the git repo.

The new git tree will be this one:
  http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git
  git://xenbits.xen.org/xen.git
For committers it will be accessible via
  xenbits.xen.org:/home/xen/git/xen.git

It has a branch corresponding to each xen*.hg tree:
  master                xen-unstable.hg
  stable-4.0            xen-4.0-testing.hg
  stable-4.1            xen-4.1-testing.hg
  stable-4.2            xen-4.2-testing.hg
  staging               staging/xen-unstable.hg
  staging-4.0           staging/xen-4.0-testing.hg
  staging-4.1           staging/xen-4.1-testing.hg
  staging-4.2           staging/xen-4.2-testing.hg

We have some background infrastructure work which needs to be complete
before we make this switch, but we are currently expecting/hoping this
to be ready next week.  We tentatively intend to make the switch on
Thursday the 13th of February, assuming none of the committers object.

Committers please note that if you have commits (patch queues) in hg
at this point, they will need to be transferred into git somehow to be
committed and pushed.  After the switch it will not be possible to
accept changes from hg, because we won't have bidirectional mirroring.

If at the point we make the change there are changes in staging that
have not propagated to the corresponding stable or master tree, this
situation will be preserved.  However, revision history will be broken
(by the difference in revision ids), which will slightly weaken the
autotester's push gate.  I therefore recommend that we avoid making
this change if we have a big or scary backlog in any staging tree.

People posting and approving patches, including maintainers, are not
directly affected.

The process will be as follows:
  1. Autotester push gate shut down
  2. Announcement and coordination with committers
  3. hg trees made read-only (other than by forthcoming git->hg mirror)
  4. hg->git mirroring process stopped
  5. git tree made writeable by committers.
  6. git->hg mirror outputs checked for sanity
  7. git->hg mirror enabled, pointing at old hg trees
  8. Autotester push gate told to use git and restarted

If any committer needs help getting git to work please feel free to
ask.  git has many advantages but its user interface has received very
mixed reviews.  We appreciate that you might need handholding.  So if
you get confused, or into trouble, do consult.

Ian.

1, VM Snapshots
Date of insert: 16/01/2013
Mentor: Stefano Stabellini <stefano.stabellini@eu.citrix.com>
Difficulty: Medium
Skills Needed: C programming
Description: Although xl is capable of saving and restoring a running VM, it is not currently possible to create a snapshot of the disk together with the rest of the VM.

QEMU is capable of creating, listing and deleting disk snapshots on QCOW2 and QED files, so even today, issuing the right commands via the QEMU monitor, it is possible to create disk snapshots of a running Xen VM. xl and libxl don't have any knowledge of these snapshots, don't know how to create, list or delete them.

This project is about implementing disk snapshots support in libxl, using the QMP protocol to issue commands to QEMU. Users should be able to manage the entire life-cycle of their disk snapshots via xl.
The candidate should also explore ways to integrate QEMU disk snapshots and disk mirroring into the regular Xen save/restore mechanisms and provide a solid implementation for xl/libxl.
Outcomes:  

Basic goal: disk snapshots can be handled entirely by xl.
Stretch goals: xl can automatically save a disk snapshot at the time of saving a VM. xl can also mirror the disk of a VM between two hosts and can do that automatically at the time of VM migration.
Steps:  

Basic steps:

    Study libxl APIs for storage
    Study QEMU QMP commands for VM snapshots
    Implement support for QMP snapshots commands in libxl
    Implement VM snapshots functionalities in libxl using the QMP functions previously written
    Add VM snapshot commands to XL 

Stretch goals:

    Add VM snapshot functionalities to libxl save/restore and migration functions
    Evaluate QEMU QMP disk mirroring capabilities (QMP command "drive-mirror")
    Implement support for QMP drive-mirror command in libxl
    Hook disk mirroring into libxl VM save/restore and migration functions (migrating a VM from one host to another is also capable of migrating the VM disk from the two hosts).
2, Mini-os for ARM (autotranslated) guests
Date of insert: 2013-02-13
Mentor: Ian Campbell <ian.campbell@citrix.com>
Difficulty: Difficult
Skills Needed: C programming. ARM (and optionally x86) assembly language debugging. Low-level kernel understanding (e.g. page tables)
Description: Mini-OS is a simple reference PV guest operating system which serves as both an example of how to write a PV guest as well as providing the base Operating Systems for StubDom Stub Domains such as Device Model Stub Domains and xenstored stub domains. Parts of Mini-OS are also used in projects such as Mirage and other exo-kernel projects.

Mini-OS supports a single address space application running directly in the bare Virtual Machine environment and contains PV drivers for disk, net and console as well as a simple co-operative threading model.

Currently minios supports only x86 PV guests however we would also like to eventually support stubdomains (in particular xenstored stub domains) and projects such as Mirage on the ARM port of Xen. This project would involve taking the existing Mini-OS code (see extras/mini-os in the Xen source code) and extending it to work in the ARM PV environment.

As well as authoring the initial bring up code targeting ARM this will also involve modifying the rest of Mini-OS to cope with the fact that Xen ARM guests do not use PV paging but instead rely on hardware virtual paging. This will require modifications to some of the core helper routines and PV drivers to understand this autotranslated physmap concept (which refers to the idea that guest address are automatically translated into host addresses, compared with x86 PV domains which must perform this translation themselves, using the physmap (or p2m) which is part of the X86 PV paging interfaces).
As an extension once Mini-OS has been extended to work in the ARM environment using autotranslated physmap this should allow a relatively easy port to an X86 HVM environment, which also differs from X86 PV in its use of autotranslated physmap. This would be useful for running fuzz testers, such as that proposed above as well as other test applications.
Outcomes: Mini-OS based domains running
Steps:  

    Simple Hello World on ARM
    stub C or ocaml xenstored running on ARM.
    Simple Hello World on x86 HVM.
    ...TBD...

Hi,

It is with great regret that we have to announce that Pascal has decided 
to leave the openSUSE board. Due to changes in Pascal's life he feels he 
is no longer able to commit the necessary time and energy to the 
openSUSE project and the openSUSE board.

As we all know, Pascal has given a lot of time to the project and the 
community. He has always been willing to help, teach, and maintain. We 
thank Pascal very much for his past contributions and wish him all the 
best. We hope that at some point in the future, life presents another 
opportunity for Pascal to get re-involved with the project and the 
community.

Pascal, thank you for everything you have contributed to the openSUSE 
project.

The board would like to welcome Richard Brown as its newest member to
fill the seat vacated by Pascal. Richard received the 3rd most votes
in the recent election, and was endorsed by Pascal as a preferred
candidate for the vacated seat. Richard's term will run to the next
election.

Regards,
Your openSUSE Board

1, "Marie Louise van Deutekom"_email_"SUSE is Hiring!"_20130313_0610
Dear SUSE colleagues,

Over 25 positions have now been approved for SUSE in FY14 and we currently have 47 positions open for which we're actively recruiting.

Our recruiting focus for the next FY is to further develop what we've built this year.

   1. Continuously improving and refreshing our www.suse.com/careers website and other Internet sites (LinkedIn careers section)

      This project is spearheaded by Libusa Volekova, HRA in Prague, who's working with various stakeholders in the SUSE (and TAG) organization.


   2. Two weeks ago, the SUSE site optimized for SEO (search engine optimization) went live. Great work from Sandy Moselle and her team and a huge step forward for SUSE – now we are much easier to find online!

      You can find the SEO site at jobs.novell.com/careers/suse-jobs. I'm sure you want to know why it has a reference to Novell and not stand alone SUSE. The answer is that Novell had SEO for years. By piggy-bagging now on the Novell history, SUSE is much sooner showing up high in the search results then by organic searches then in a situation where SUSE had to start from scratch. And it works – if you type in Google "SUSE engineer Nurnberg" you will find SUSE jobs. A month ago you would not have been able to find much related to SUSE! If you type in "Software Engineer Nurnberg" we are on page 2 – again a major improvement from a before the SEO was active.


   3. Expanding our on- and offline network recruiting activities.

      Amongst others: Professionalizing event-recruiting: attached is the new recruiting flyer, see below for a small pic of the pull up and table top banner.

How Can You Help?

The recruiting team (Joe Goss, David Korbel, Nadine Pieper, Christian Roch, Libusa Volekova, Claudia Ping and many others) is making a fast start with sourcing candidates for all the open positions. But we need your continuous support!

    * Distribute open positions in your (online) network and actively look inside your network for potential candidates:

          o Feel free to share the attached flyer.
          o Follow us on Twitter: twitter.com/SUSECareers 


    * When you are at an event: always keep an eye open for potential candidates – get connected off line and/or online and share contact details with the SUSE recruiters


    * Don't forget the referral policy - we'd rather pay a referral bonus to you than pay an agency!


    * And share this through twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook/Google+: "SUSE is growing! Exciting new sales & engineering positions at SUSE locations globally http://bit.ly/Yu8ije" 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your ongoing support,

14:24 2013-03-13
virtualization, libvirt, xen, patch, lock, cont2, modify for xen4.2, cont4
1, AFAIK, libxl could not get the response message from libxl-save-helper.
try to debug and figure it out.
2, 
helper_setcallbacks_save set suspend function:
    cbs->suspend = (cbflags & (1u<<3)) ? helper_stub_suspend : 0;

called in xc_domain_save while it is a non-live suspend.
    suspend_and_state

So, suspend function should be called. even if i set ao_how wrong.
1), 第一次测试失败了

4), the last function in gdb log is libxl__srm_callout_sendreply in the last virsh save test. and because the libxl__srm_callout_callback_complete is called, i could know that the xl get the messsge from libxl-save-helper.
所以之前猜测的complete没有收到是不对的.
i need to know what should be done after libxl__srm_callout_callback_complete and libxl__srm_callout_sendreply. \TODO.

3, from jim commnet, i guess that i should use ao_how but do not use callback?
check how the NEW_EVENT works in xenlight.

4, (10:52 2013-03-14)
1), read the code about how NEW_EVENT works.
domain_death_occurred: NEW_EVENT and sent ev through libxl__event_occurred. but i do not know which switch will be chosed in libxl__event_occurred. add print info for it.

(3), 跟踪后才注意到EGC_FREE
#define EGC_FREE           libxl__egc_cleanup(egc)
上周如果注意到这一点, 早就往下走了. 
EGC_FREE is caleld the following functions: libxl_osevent_beforepoll, libxl_osevent_afterpoll, libxl_osevent_occurred_fd, libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout, libxl_event_check, libxl_event_wait, libxl_childproc_reaped, AO_INPROGRESS, AO_ABORT.
但问题是AO_INPROGESS也是会调用EGC_FREE, 感觉怪怪的.
(4), it seems that the EGC_FREE is not what i want. 
try to dig into the save process without ao_how.
(5), ao_how == NULL.
it looks like libxl__self_pipe_eatall get the result from libxl__poller_wakeup.

sigchld_handler set to SIGCHLD by the libxl__ev_child_fork. which called while libxl-save-helper is forked.
总是忘了fork返回值的含义. 0: 返回子进程. n(>0): 返回父进程.
summary for xenlight save routine.
run_helper fork the child process for run libxl-save-helper.  
\TODO: what does the sigchld_handler for?

后来又仔细看了看代码, 感觉会不会是ao_how不是NULL时, 所有的fd和time callback都没有执行?
(1), from the debug log, libxl__srm_callout_callback_progress is called lots of times. this function is a logging function.
xtl_progress is added in commit 7f9a888a: xtl: New xentoollog mini-library
xtl means "xentoollog"
besides, log and progress, only suspend and complete is called during virsh save.
but these function are called by helper_stdout_readable which is definitely called by libvirt event handler. it is not make sense. why these function are not called while ao_how is not NULL.
再继续debug, helper_stdout_readable以及最终调用的log, progress, suspend, complete数目都相投, 也就是说到这里还是正确的.

software skill, debug, gdb, get struct offset
1, from:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9788679/how-to-get-the-relative-adress-of-a-field-in-a-structure-dump-c
http://elinux.org/GDB_Tips
2, gdb command
(gdb) print (int)&((struct A*)0)->a
or
(gdb) print/d &((struct A*)0)->a
3, python
If you need to do it for a large number of fields, then you may find it handy to use GDB's new python interface (you'll need a recent version of GDB to use it, I'm using 7.4). I've created offsets.py:

import gdb

class Offsets(gdb.Command):
    def __init__(self):
        super (Offsets, self).__init__ ('offsets-of', gdb.COMMAND_DATA)

    def invoke(self, arg, from_tty):
        argv = gdb.string_to_argv(arg)
        if len(argv) != 1:
            raise gdb.GdbError('offsets-of takes exactly 1 argument.')

        stype = gdb.lookup_type(argv[0])

        print argv[0], '{'
        for field in stype.fields():
            print '    %s => %d' % (field.name, field.bitpos//8)
        print '}'

Offsets()

Then you can add to your .gdbinit:

python
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/script/dir')
import offsets
end

Then using it in GDB, like:

(gdb) offsets-of "struct A"
struct A {
    a => 0
    b => 4
    c => 6
}

company, suse, maintenance, sle11, sles11 sp3 only have sp3 repo do not have sp2 repo
highlight: SLES 11 SP3 will have only one official update repository (SP3-Updates).
1, ""Simona Arsene" <sarsene@suse.com>"_email_"[devel] SLES 11 SP3 Channel Setup"_20130314_2345
Hi, 

based on the questions raised in the last couple of days, I would like to share with everyone the channel setup for
SLES 11 SP3. 
(for the new colleagues, I have added some 'Background info' so that you can better understand the setup) 

==============================================
Highlights:
==============================================
SLES 11 SP3 will have only one official update repository (SP3-Updates), but customers are allowed
and educated how to manually add older repository (e.g.
SLES 11 SP1 Updates, SLES 11 SP2 Updates, etc), even when being registered directly to NCC.
Previously this was only possible when using SMT or SUSE Manager.


Background info: 
==============================================
Over the last years with a clear desire for improvements based on customers feedback,
SUSE has implemented various changes regarding the way we deliver updates to our users. 

- in SLES 9, there was only one update repository that collected all the updates; the most recent
release update was the only one to be supported.
– Starting with SLES 10 SP1, the concept of a “SP specific repository” has been introduced. This
means that all the updates for a specific Service Pack are delivered in one specific repository.
Once users migrate to a newer Service Pack, they lose access to the preceding repositories if
they registered directly to NCC. Users of SMT or SUSE Manager were able and are still able to
subscribe to any SP channel freely
The main reason for this change was the concept of a 6 months overlap period (n-1 service
pack support) to allow validation of the released service pack and a window of migration for
customers, where they would be continued to be maintained and supported fully within the old
SP
– SLES 11 GA and SLES 11 SP1 have followed the SLES 10 model. With SLES 11 SP2 we
introduced a new repository model, consisting of the following:
i.SLES 11 SP1 Updates repository remained subscribed. All updates that were also
applicable to SP2 were also or only released into the SP1 Updates repository, which
means that all the updates that don't break the ABI and API compatibility should
have continued to be delivered here.
ii. SLES 11 SP2 Updates repository includes only the latest and innovative updates that
can't be delivered on the SP1 Updates Repository (for various reasons).
In addition to this, we introduced a Core Repository, which provided the “gap” of
packages that were neither released into SP1-Updates or SP2-Updates repository.


SLES 11 SP3 Channel Setup
==============================================
SLES 11 SP3 will have only one official update repository (SP3-Updates), but users can access other patches via the
download webpage or by enabling older channels for their products. 

Q1: What channels should a SLES 11 SP3 user have? 
SLES11-SP3-Pool
SLES11-SP3-Updates
SLES11-SP3-Extensions
SLE11-SP3-Debuginfo-Pool
SLE11-SP3-Debuginfo-Updates 

As you know from SLES 11 SP1, the pool channel (SLES11-SP3-Pool) will include the media and will not change during the
lifetime of the Service Pack. 
The SLES11-SP3-Updates will be populated with updates that will be released for SP3. 

Q2: From where should a SP3 user get his update? 
All the updates for SP3 will be available in the SLES11-SP3-Updates (and only in this channel). 

Q3: Where can I get more info regarding the SLES 11 SP2 channel setup in order to understand this change? 
In case you want to learn more about the SP2 channel setup, please check the release notes
https://www.suse.com/documentation/sled11/singlehtml/book_sle_deployment/book_sle_deployment.html#cha.update.sle
and the available TID (http://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7010225 )

In case you have questions regarding the support statements, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

If there are additional questions that I have not covered in this email, please feel free to reach out to me.

抱歉。
不想影响team.
正好lock patch有个问题卡住我很久。
xen4.3有一些改进，工作中可能早晚会遇到，如果一起讨论可能会有帮助。
hackweek我之前也考虑过，但不成熟，下次Jason问，可以讨论一下。
