suse, sle11 sp3, documentation, release notes
"Antoine Ginies <aginies@suse.com>"_email_"Documentation/RN for SL11 SP3"_20130301_0321
a short message to remind you that the content of the release notes/doc should
came from PrjMgr, PM and engineers. Try to keep our Doc/RN synchronise
and up to date is really important and is the best way to have a good product.
The team has spent time to work on features, improvements, bug fixes for
SP3, this should be visisble outside.

Thanks in advance to take care of your fate, and see if you can help in
the doc process, or RN.

regards.

Antoine

kernel, release, 3.8, f2fs
Summary: f2fs is a new filesystem for FTL enabled device, such as SSDs, eMMC, SD cards,
https://lwn.net/Articles/518988/
f2fs (interestingly not "f3s") is the "flash-friendly file system", a new filesystem for Linux recently announced by engineers from Samsung. Unlike jffs2 and logfs, f2fs is not targeted at raw flash devices, but rather at the specific hardware that is commonly available to consumers — SSDs, eMMC, SD cards, and other flash storage with an FTL (flash translation layer) already built in. It seems that as hardware gets smarter, we need to make even more clever software to manage that "smartness". Does this sound like parenting to anyone else?

f2fs is based on the log-structured filesystem (LFS) design — which is hardly surprising given the close match between the log-structuring approach and the needs of flash. For those not familiar with log-structured design, the key elements are:

    That it requires copy-on-write, so data is always written to previously unused space.

    That free space is managed in large regions which are written to sequentially. When the number of free regions gets low, data that is still live is coalesced from several regions into one free region, thus creating more free regions. This process is known as "cleaning" and the overhead it causes is one of the significant costs of log structuring.

virtualization, xen, move from hv to git; hg to git flow
"Ian Jackson <Ian.Jackson@xxxxxxxxxxxxx>"_email_"[Xen-devel] Moving xen*.hg to git"_20130213_1708
As previously agreed, we will be moving the main Xen trees to git.
The existing .hg trees will continue to exist, but as hg mirrors of
the git history.  Committers will push to the git repo.

The new git tree will be this one:
  http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git
  git://xenbits.xen.org/xen.git
For committers it will be accessible via
  xenbits.xen.org:/home/xen/git/xen.git

It has a branch corresponding to each xen*.hg tree:
  master                xen-unstable.hg
  stable-4.0            xen-4.0-testing.hg
  stable-4.1            xen-4.1-testing.hg
  stable-4.2            xen-4.2-testing.hg
  staging               staging/xen-unstable.hg
  staging-4.0           staging/xen-4.0-testing.hg
  staging-4.1           staging/xen-4.1-testing.hg
  staging-4.2           staging/xen-4.2-testing.hg

We have some background infrastructure work which needs to be complete
before we make this switch, but we are currently expecting/hoping this
to be ready next week.  We tentatively intend to make the switch on
Thursday the 13th of February, assuming none of the committers object.

Committers please note that if you have commits (patch queues) in hg
at this point, they will need to be transferred into git somehow to be
committed and pushed.  After the switch it will not be possible to
accept changes from hg, because we won't have bidirectional mirroring.

If at the point we make the change there are changes in staging that
have not propagated to the corresponding stable or master tree, this
situation will be preserved.  However, revision history will be broken
(by the difference in revision ids), which will slightly weaken the
autotester's push gate.  I therefore recommend that we avoid making
this change if we have a big or scary backlog in any staging tree.

People posting and approving patches, including maintainers, are not
directly affected.

The process will be as follows:
  1. Autotester push gate shut down
  2. Announcement and coordination with committers
  3. hg trees made read-only (other than by forthcoming git->hg mirror)
  4. hg->git mirroring process stopped
  5. git tree made writeable by committers.
  6. git->hg mirror outputs checked for sanity
  7. git->hg mirror enabled, pointing at old hg trees
  8. Autotester push gate told to use git and restarted

If any committer needs help getting git to work please feel free to
ask.  git has many advantages but its user interface has received very
mixed reviews.  We appreciate that you might need handholding.  So if
you get confused, or into trouble, do consult.

Ian.
