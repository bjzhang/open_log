"Antoine Ginies <aginies@suse.com>"_email_"Documentation/RN for SL11 SP3"_20130301_0321
a short message to remind you that the content of the release notes/doc should
came from PrjMgr, PM and engineers. Try to keep our Doc/RN synchronise
and up to date is really important and is the best way to have a good product.
The team has spent time to work on features, improvements, bug fixes for
SP3, this should be visisble outside.

Thanks in advance to take care of your fate, and see if you can help in
the doc process, or RN.

kernel, release, 3.8, f2fs
Summary: f2fs is a new filesystem for FTL enabled device, such as SSDs, eMMC, SD cards,
https://lwn.net/Articles/518988/
f2fs (interestingly not "f3s") is the "flash-friendly file system", a new filesystem for Linux recently announced by engineers from Samsung. Unlike jffs2 and logfs, f2fs is not targeted at raw flash devices, but rather at the specific hardware that is commonly available to consumers — SSDs, eMMC, SD cards, and other flash storage with an FTL (flash translation layer) already built in. It seems that as hardware gets smarter, we need to make even more clever software to manage that "smartness". Does this sound like parenting to anyone else?

f2fs is based on the log-structured filesystem (LFS) design — which is hardly surprising given the close match between the log-structuring approach and the needs of flash. For those not familiar with log-structured design, the key elements are:

    That it requires copy-on-write, so data is always written to previously unused space.

    That free space is managed in large regions which are written to sequentially. When the number of free regions gets low, data that is still live is coalesced from several regions into one free region, thus creating more free regions. This process is known as "cleaning" and the overhead it causes is one of the significant costs of log structuring.

virtualization, xen, move from hv to git; hg to git flow
"Ian Jackson <Ian.Jackson@xxxxxxxxxxxxx>"_email_"[Xen-devel] Moving xen*.hg to git"_20130213_1708
As previously agreed, we will be moving the main Xen trees to git.
The existing .hg trees will continue to exist, but as hg mirrors of
the git history.  Committers will push to the git repo.

The new git tree will be this one:
  http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git
  git://xenbits.xen.org/xen.git
For committers it will be accessible via
  xenbits.xen.org:/home/xen/git/xen.git

It has a branch corresponding to each xen*.hg tree:
  master                xen-unstable.hg
  stable-4.0            xen-4.0-testing.hg
  stable-4.1            xen-4.1-testing.hg
  stable-4.2            xen-4.2-testing.hg
  staging               staging/xen-unstable.hg
  staging-4.0           staging/xen-4.0-testing.hg
  staging-4.1           staging/xen-4.1-testing.hg
  staging-4.2           staging/xen-4.2-testing.hg

We have some background infrastructure work which needs to be complete
before we make this switch, but we are currently expecting/hoping this
to be ready next week.  We tentatively intend to make the switch on
Thursday the 13th of February, assuming none of the committers object.

Committers please note that if you have commits (patch queues) in hg
at this point, they will need to be transferred into git somehow to be
committed and pushed.  After the switch it will not be possible to
accept changes from hg, because we won't have bidirectional mirroring.

If at the point we make the change there are changes in staging that
have not propagated to the corresponding stable or master tree, this
situation will be preserved.  However, revision history will be broken
(by the difference in revision ids), which will slightly weaken the
autotester's push gate.  I therefore recommend that we avoid making
this change if we have a big or scary backlog in any staging tree.

People posting and approving patches, including maintainers, are not
directly affected.

The process will be as follows:
  1. Autotester push gate shut down
  2. Announcement and coordination with committers
  3. hg trees made read-only (other than by forthcoming git->hg mirror)
  4. hg->git mirroring process stopped
  5. git tree made writeable by committers.
  6. git->hg mirror outputs checked for sanity
  7. git->hg mirror enabled, pointing at old hg trees
  8. Autotester push gate told to use git and restarted

If any committer needs help getting git to work please feel free to
ask.  git has many advantages but its user interface has received very
mixed reviews.  We appreciate that you might need handholding.  So if
you get confused, or into trouble, do consult.

Ian.

1, VM Snapshots
Date of insert: 16/01/2013
Mentor: Stefano Stabellini <stefano.stabellini@eu.citrix.com>
Difficulty: Medium
Skills Needed: C programming
Description: Although xl is capable of saving and restoring a running VM, it is not currently possible to create a snapshot of the disk together with the rest of the VM.

QEMU is capable of creating, listing and deleting disk snapshots on QCOW2 and QED files, so even today, issuing the right commands via the QEMU monitor, it is possible to create disk snapshots of a running Xen VM. xl and libxl don't have any knowledge of these snapshots, don't know how to create, list or delete them.

This project is about implementing disk snapshots support in libxl, using the QMP protocol to issue commands to QEMU. Users should be able to manage the entire life-cycle of their disk snapshots via xl.
The candidate should also explore ways to integrate QEMU disk snapshots and disk mirroring into the regular Xen save/restore mechanisms and provide a solid implementation for xl/libxl.
Outcomes:  

Basic goal: disk snapshots can be handled entirely by xl.
Stretch goals: xl can automatically save a disk snapshot at the time of saving a VM. xl can also mirror the disk of a VM between two hosts and can do that automatically at the time of VM migration.
Steps:  

Basic steps:

    Study libxl APIs for storage
    Study QEMU QMP commands for VM snapshots
    Implement support for QMP snapshots commands in libxl
    Implement VM snapshots functionalities in libxl using the QMP functions previously written
    Add VM snapshot commands to XL 

Stretch goals:

    Add VM snapshot functionalities to libxl save/restore and migration functions
    Evaluate QEMU QMP disk mirroring capabilities (QMP command "drive-mirror")
    Implement support for QMP drive-mirror command in libxl
    Hook disk mirroring into libxl VM save/restore and migration functions (migrating a VM from one host to another is also capable of migrating the VM disk from the two hosts).
2, Mini-os for ARM (autotranslated) guests
Date of insert: 2013-02-13
Mentor: Ian Campbell <ian.campbell@citrix.com>
Difficulty: Difficult
Skills Needed: C programming. ARM (and optionally x86) assembly language debugging. Low-level kernel understanding (e.g. page tables)
Description: Mini-OS is a simple reference PV guest operating system which serves as both an example of how to write a PV guest as well as providing the base Operating Systems for StubDom Stub Domains such as Device Model Stub Domains and xenstored stub domains. Parts of Mini-OS are also used in projects such as Mirage and other exo-kernel projects.

Mini-OS supports a single address space application running directly in the bare Virtual Machine environment and contains PV drivers for disk, net and console as well as a simple co-operative threading model.

Currently minios supports only x86 PV guests however we would also like to eventually support stubdomains (in particular xenstored stub domains) and projects such as Mirage on the ARM port of Xen. This project would involve taking the existing Mini-OS code (see extras/mini-os in the Xen source code) and extending it to work in the ARM PV environment.

As well as authoring the initial bring up code targeting ARM this will also involve modifying the rest of Mini-OS to cope with the fact that Xen ARM guests do not use PV paging but instead rely on hardware virtual paging. This will require modifications to some of the core helper routines and PV drivers to understand this autotranslated physmap concept (which refers to the idea that guest address are automatically translated into host addresses, compared with x86 PV domains which must perform this translation themselves, using the physmap (or p2m) which is part of the X86 PV paging interfaces).
As an extension once Mini-OS has been extended to work in the ARM environment using autotranslated physmap this should allow a relatively easy port to an X86 HVM environment, which also differs from X86 PV in its use of autotranslated physmap. This would be useful for running fuzz testers, such as that proposed above as well as other test applications.
Outcomes: Mini-OS based domains running
Steps:  

    Simple Hello World on ARM
    stub C or ocaml xenstored running on ARM.
    Simple Hello World on x86 HVM.
    ...TBD...

Hi,

It is with great regret that we have to announce that Pascal has decided 
to leave the openSUSE board. Due to changes in Pascal's life he feels he 
is no longer able to commit the necessary time and energy to the 
openSUSE project and the openSUSE board.

As we all know, Pascal has given a lot of time to the project and the 
community. He has always been willing to help, teach, and maintain. We 
thank Pascal very much for his past contributions and wish him all the 
best. We hope that at some point in the future, life presents another 
opportunity for Pascal to get re-involved with the project and the 
community.

Pascal, thank you for everything you have contributed to the openSUSE 
project.

The board would like to welcome Richard Brown as its newest member to
fill the seat vacated by Pascal. Richard received the 3rd most votes
in the recent election, and was endorsed by Pascal as a preferred
candidate for the vacated seat. Richard's term will run to the next
election.

Regards,
Your openSUSE Board
