"Agustin Benito Bethencourt <abebe@suse.com>"_email_"[devel] new openSUSE Team member: Antonio Larrosa"_20130802_1721
Hi,

I am happy to announce that Antonio Larrosa Jiménez joined yesterday the 
openSUSE Team at SUSE. He will work remotely from Spain.  He is not new at 
SUSE since he worked here for a year back in 2000.

Antonio is a KDE developer. Those of you who contributed to that project years 
ago will certainly know him. He will replace Will Stephenson as the KDE L3 
maintainer.

Antonio has been working the last 10 years in a company called Tedial that 
develop a real time backup system for multimedia-tv companies. The last years 
he also teached OS at Malaga College for IT students. 

Until August 9th he is in our offices in Nuremberg.

Welcome back Antonio.

Saludos

1, "Jason Douglas <jdouglas@suse.com>"_email_"[devel] New Colleague in Virtualization Team -- Mike Latimer"
It is my pleasure to announce that Mike Latimer is the newest member of 
the Virtualization Team within the SLE Department. Mike lives in Utah 
and will join the SUSE team on the 5th floor in Provo.

Many of you might know Mike from NTS where he has spent nearly 20 years 
doing backline support on various products. We are confident that his 
experience will be a great asset to the team, and will allow him to hit 
the ground running as he transitions to development work around Xen and 
KVM.

Please join me in welcoming Mike to this new position.

Thanks!
Jason Douglas

because it is the only thing missing in libvirt but inplement in afterpoll_internal.

There is no general rule. There is a white-paper on VT, he should help
you understand which host/guest scenario we support:

This is true, we support any SLES as guest on any older SLES as long as
both are under support.
There is one exception: 
we are not able to boot a SLE11 SP3 PV guest on SLE10 SP4 (secure boot
issue).

virtualization, xen, libxl, async, try ao_how, cont2, debug save, cont3
1, 现在的关键问题是helper_exited没有人调用.
helper_exited will be called during childproc_reaped: ch->callback.

libxl__fork_selfpipe_woken -> childproc_reaped
libxl_childproc_reaped -> childproc_reaped

i could call libxl_childproc_reaped in libxl driver. but when?
1), read the doc about subprocess handling. in xen/tools/libxl/libxl_event.h
according to this doc, i should call libxl_childproc_setmode.
using libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop or libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always?

2), if use libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always
 *     libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always:
 *       The application expects libxl to reap all of its children,
 *       and provides a callback to be notified of their exit
 *       statues.

sigchld_handler is installed when libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always set. sigchld_handler will write to sigchld_owner->sigchld_selfpipe[1]. who listen this?
i could register this to libvirt event loop then call the callback by myself.

3), if use libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop 
i need to hand the signal in libvirt. it seems that there is no libvirt common function for this. except the virnetserver.c, the latter one is too complex for my requirement.

2, try libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always
1), register event to loop.
2), libxl_childproc_reaped need pid of child process.
should i get pid from fork_replacement? yes.
sigchld_selfpipe could not get from libxl outside. i need to modify the code.

3, currently, there are three choices for me, i am trying choice 2).
1), using ao_how without callback -> libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop
2), using ao_how without callback -> libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always?
3), using ao_how with callback

Hi, Maxime 

I saw your A31 patch sent to linux-arm.
i want to test your patch in my mele M9 box(A31 with 2G memory).
but i fail on u-boot loading kernel.
i am not sure if the u-boot ship with my box is too old to using the dtb and kernel.
So, if u could give me some instruction about how to make a bootable sd card and your u-boot and initfs. i will appreciate that, thanks.

do i need to use fex?

I have found this:  
http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Storage_XenMotion and I would like to know if we support this kind of technology (storage live
migration without shared storage). 
And Is there any similar for KVM?

Storage XenMotion is supported by the XCP toolstack from Citrix, which
is not provided in SLES.

libvirt's migrate API supports a VIR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_DISK flag, which
is implemented in the QEMU/KVM driver.  With virsh, you should be able
to do something like

virsh migrate vm-name --copy-storage-all ...

Jim

Although available for KVM, we haven't stated support for storage migration.
We could certainly consider it if there is customer demand.

[Xen-devel] How ARM Xen process the harddisk requests from DomU

Xen on ARM supports only PV devices, so the PV disk backend will deal
with it. I'm not sure anyone has tried qdisk on ARM, although it should
work fine, but I expect most people are currently using the in-kernel
blkback driver in their driver domain.

All ARM domains run with hardware nested page tables ("second stage
paging" in ARM speak, equivalent to HAP for x86 HVM guests). So an IOMMU
is needed to translate guest physical addresses into host physical
addresses for the device e.g. for doing DMA.

allwinner, A31, mele M9
1, Bob Ham <rah@settrans.net>
Hi there,

I've just got a Mele A1000G which you stated is the same as the A1000
you unboxed here:

  http://xen_on_arm.farbox.com/post/mele_m9_quadcore

I'd like to get the serial output from u-boot in order to work on Linux
on the device.  In your hacking page, you noted a 3v3 uart: "the uart
pin is same as mele A1000, from left to right: 3v3, Tx, Rx, Gnd".

However, it isn't clear which connector you're referring to on the
board.  Could you possible tell me which connector is the UART? :-)

Any help is much appreciated.

Kind regards,

Bob Ham

2, reply
Hi, Bob

glad to see more and more people hacking A31. and sorry to late to reply to u.
my box is a engineering test version of mele M9. i am not sure it is same or not with
your box.

could u see the right-down connector in my inside picture(next to the last picture)?
that is the uart connector. there are four pins in that, 3v3, Tx, Rx, Gnd.
AFAIK, there is only one four pins connector in this board.

BTW, i am trying to port xen to A31. currently, i need a upstream kernel. and recently, 
Maxime Ripard(maxime.ripard@free-electrons.com) send the A31 patches to linux-arm-kernel
 and linux-sunxi mailing list. but i do not get a chance to test it.
will u try it?

and if u could get any kernel and filsystem running successful on A31. i could package 
it to opensuse arm. it would be useful for others one.

regards

bamvor
