"Agustin Benito Bethencourt <abebe@suse.com>"_email_"[devel] new openSUSE Team member: Antonio Larrosa"_20130802_1721
Hi,

I am happy to announce that Antonio Larrosa Jiménez joined yesterday the 
openSUSE Team at SUSE. He will work remotely from Spain.  He is not new at 
SUSE since he worked here for a year back in 2000.

Antonio is a KDE developer. Those of you who contributed to that project years 
ago will certainly know him. He will replace Will Stephenson as the KDE L3 
maintainer.

Antonio has been working the last 10 years in a company called Tedial that 
develop a real time backup system for multimedia-tv companies. The last years 
he also teached OS at Malaga College for IT students. 

Until August 9th he is in our offices in Nuremberg.

Welcome back Antonio.

Saludos

"Jason Douglas <jdouglas@suse.com>"_email_"[devel] New Colleague in Virtualization Team -- Mike Latimer"
It is my pleasure to announce that Mike Latimer is the newest member of 
the Virtualization Team within the SLE Department. Mike lives in Utah 
and will join the SUSE team on the 5th floor in Provo.

Many of you might know Mike from NTS where he has spent nearly 20 years 
doing backline support on various products. We are confident that his 
experience will be a great asset to the team, and will allow him to hit 
the ground running as he transitions to development work around Xen and 
KVM.

Please join me in welcoming Mike to this new position.

Thanks!
Jason Douglas

3, modify gic according to Maxime Ripard patch
1),

2), uart0

        reg-io-width = <4>;
        clocks = <&osc>;
        status = "disabled";
};

the following line is important:
        interrupts = <0 0 1>;
it will be pass after changing this.

4, \TODO fix this

1, plan 
1), why the first time call libxl__ao_complete_check_progress_reports not report the complete. i need this.

2, 
helper_exited
helper_done
libxl__domain_suspend_device_model

3, i think i should add the libxl__fork_selfpipe_woken things to libxl_osevent_hooks.
because it is the only thing missing in libvirt but inplement in afterpoll_internal.

    int selfpipe = libxl__fork_selfpipe_active(CTX);
    if (selfpipe >= 0 &&
        afterpoll_check_fd(poller,fds,nfds, selfpipe, POLLIN)) {
        int e = libxl__self_pipe_eatall(selfpipe);
        if (e) LIBXL__EVENT_DISASTER(egc, "read sigchld pipe", e, 0);
        libxl__fork_selfpipe_woken(egc);
    }

There is no general rule. There is a white-paper on VT, he should help
you understand which host/guest scenario we support:

This is true, we support any SLES as guest on any older SLES as long as
both are under support.
There is one exception: 
we are not able to boot a SLE11 SP3 PV guest on SLE10 SP4 (secure boot
issue).

virtualization, xen, libxl, async, try ao_how, cont2, debug save, cont3
1, 现在的关键问题是helper_exited没有人调用.
helper_exited will be called during childproc_reaped: ch->callback.

libxl__fork_selfpipe_woken -> childproc_reaped
libxl_childproc_reaped -> childproc_reaped

i could call libxl_childproc_reaped in libxl driver. but when?
1), read the doc about subprocess handling. in xen/tools/libxl/libxl_event.h
according to this doc, i should call libxl_childproc_setmode.
using libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop or libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always?

2), if use libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always
 *     libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always:
 *       The application expects libxl to reap all of its children,
 *       and provides a callback to be notified of their exit
 *       statues.

sigchld_handler is installed when libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always set. sigchld_handler will write to sigchld_owner->sigchld_selfpipe[1]. who listen this?
i could register this to libvirt event loop then call the callback by myself.

3), if use libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop 
i need to hand the signal in libvirt. it seems that there is no libvirt common function for this. except the virnetserver.c, the latter one is too complex for my requirement.

2, try libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always
1), register event to loop.
2), libxl_childproc_reaped need pid of child process.
should i get pid from fork_replacement? yes.
sigchld_selfpipe could not get from libxl outside. i need to modify the code.

3, currently, there are three choices for me, i am trying choice 2).
1), using ao_how without callback -> libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop
2), using ao_how without callback -> libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always?
3), using ao_how with callback
