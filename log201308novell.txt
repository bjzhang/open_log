"Agustin Benito Bethencourt <abebe@suse.com>"_email_"[devel] new openSUSE Team member: Antonio Larrosa"_20130802_1721
Hi,

I am happy to announce that Antonio Larrosa Jiménez joined yesterday the 
openSUSE Team at SUSE. He will work remotely from Spain.  He is not new at 
SUSE since he worked here for a year back in 2000.

Antonio is a KDE developer. Those of you who contributed to that project years 
ago will certainly know him. He will replace Will Stephenson as the KDE L3 
maintainer.

Antonio has been working the last 10 years in a company called Tedial that 
develop a real time backup system for multimedia-tv companies. The last years 
he also teached OS at Malaga College for IT students. 

Until August 9th he is in our offices in Nuremberg.

Welcome back Antonio.

Saludos

1, "Jason Douglas <jdouglas@suse.com>"_email_"[devel] New Colleague in Virtualization Team -- Mike Latimer"
It is my pleasure to announce that Mike Latimer is the newest member of 
the Virtualization Team within the SLE Department. Mike lives in Utah 
and will join the SUSE team on the 5th floor in Provo.

Many of you might know Mike from NTS where he has spent nearly 20 years 
doing backline support on various products. We are confident that his 
experience will be a great asset to the team, and will allow him to hit 
the ground running as he transitions to development work around Xen and 
KVM.

Please join me in welcoming Mike to this new position.

Thanks!

because it is the only thing missing in libvirt but inplement in afterpoll_internal.

There is no general rule. There is a white-paper on VT, he should help
you understand which host/guest scenario we support:

This is true, we support any SLES as guest on any older SLES as long as
both are under support.
There is one exception: 
we are not able to boot a SLE11 SP3 PV guest on SLE10 SP4 (secure boot
issue).

virtualization, xen, libxl, async, try ao_how, cont2, debug save, cont3
1, 现在的关键问题是helper_exited没有人调用.
helper_exited will be called during childproc_reaped: ch->callback.

libxl__fork_selfpipe_woken -> childproc_reaped
libxl_childproc_reaped -> childproc_reaped

i could call libxl_childproc_reaped in libxl driver. but when?
1), read the doc about subprocess handling. in xen/tools/libxl/libxl_event.h
according to this doc, i should call libxl_childproc_setmode.
using libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop or libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always?

2), if use libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always
 *     libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always:
 *       The application expects libxl to reap all of its children,
 *       and provides a callback to be notified of their exit
 *       statues.

sigchld_handler is installed when libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always set. sigchld_handler will write to sigchld_owner->sigchld_selfpipe[1]. who listen this?
i could register this to libvirt event loop then call the callback by myself.

3), if use libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop 
i need to hand the signal in libvirt. it seems that there is no libvirt common function for this. except the virnetserver.c, the latter one is too complex for my requirement.

2, try libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always
1), register event to loop.
2), libxl_childproc_reaped need pid of child process.
should i get pid from fork_replacement? yes.
sigchld_selfpipe could not get from libxl outside. i need to modify the code.

3, currently, there are three choices for me, i am trying choice 2).
1), using ao_how without callback -> libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop
2), using ao_how without callback -> libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always?
3), using ao_how with callback

Hi, Maxime 

this is Bamvor Jian Zhang. currently, i work on port xen to sun6i. and i need a upstream kernel for sun6i.
i have had ping u at linux-sunxi in freenode last week, and got your github branch for sun6i(https://github.com/mripard/linux/tree/sunxi-next-a31). I also saw your A31 patch sent to linux-arm.
which one should i use for boot sun6i kernel?
i test your patch in my mele M9 box(A31 with 2G memory). but i fail on u-boot loading kernel.
i am not sure if the u-boot ship with my box is too old to using the dtb and kernel.
So, could u do me a favor to give me some instruction about how to boot your kernel, including proper u-boot, cmdline and filesystem.
BTW: do i need to use fex for booting your kernel?

i am so excited to boot your kernel in my board. and i hope i could make a opensuse image for sun6i. 

thanks

Sorry about that. I'm currently on holidays, hence why I probably didn't

The github branch you picked is the latest I sent to the ML.

How so ?

What is the error from the kernel? What configuration did you use? Which
device tree did you use? How do you load the kernel and device tree
images?

I can't answer that question. You can always use CONFIG_ARM_APPENDED_DTB
if your u-boot is too old.

> BTW: do i need to use fex for booting your kernel?

No. We don't and never will support fex. We use device tree just like
any other ARM platform.

Storage XenMotion is supported by the XCP toolstack from Citrix, which
is not provided in SLES.

> And Is there any similar for KVM?

libvirt's migrate API supports a VIR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_DISK flag, which
is implemented in the QEMU/KVM driver.  With virsh, you should be able
to do something like

virsh migrate vm-name --copy-storage-all ...

Jim

Although available for KVM, we haven't stated support for storage migration.
We could certainly consider it if there is customer demand.

[Xen-devel] How ARM Xen process the harddisk requests from DomU

Xen on ARM supports only PV devices, so the PV disk backend will deal
with it. I'm not sure anyone has tried qdisk on ARM, although it should
work fine, but I expect most people are currently using the in-kernel
blkback driver in their driver domain.

All ARM domains run with hardware nested page tables ("second stage
paging" in ARM speak, equivalent to HAP for x86 HVM guests). So an IOMMU
is needed to translate guest physical addresses into host physical
addresses for the device e.g. for doing DMA.

Hi there,

I've just got a Mele A1000G which you stated is the same as the A1000
you unboxed here:

  http://xen_on_arm.farbox.com/post/mele_m9_quadcore

I'd like to get the serial output from u-boot in order to work on Linux
on the device.  In your hacking page, you noted a 3v3 uart: "the uart
pin is same as mele A1000, from left to right: 3v3, Tx, Rx, Gnd".

However, it isn't clear which connector you're referring to on the
board.  Could you possible tell me which connector is the UART? :-)

Any help is much appreciated.

Kind regards,

Bob Ham

2, reply
Hi, Bob

glad to see more and more people hacking A31. and sorry to late to reply to u.
my box is a engineering test version of mele M9. i am not sure it is same or not with
your box.

could u see the right-down connector in my inside picture(next to the last picture)?
that is the uart connector. there are four pins in that, 3v3, Tx, Rx, Gnd.
AFAIK, there is only one four pins connector in this board.

BTW, i am trying to port xen to A31. currently, i need a upstream kernel. and recently, 
Maxime Ripard(maxime.ripard@free-electrons.com) send the A31 patches to linux-arm-kernel
 and linux-sunxi mailing list. but i do not get a chance to test it.
will u try it?

and if u could get any kernel and filsystem running successful on A31. i could package 
it to opensuse arm. it would be useful for others one.

Depends if you think there's any useful info to be had from the
driver wide context object ? If so, then probably best to have a
driver-wide log file for those messages

I was going to suggest that, but IIUC, the libxl logger API requires
you to give it a FILE * instance to which it writes directly. To feed
it into our normal logs, we'd want it to let us give it a callback
for writing log messages.

Right.

I was going to pass the logger create function 'stderr' for the
driver-wide ctx.  Would that be safe?

Can we rely on open_memstream() being present on any platform with
libxl?  If so, that would give us a FILE* interface to libxl, while
still giving us access to the strings it prints which we can then turn
around and hand to our logger.

Ups! I was wondering how that could happen, since I tested this too and
it worked, but yes, I tested it on Xen too... Did not think about doing
the above, although, yes, it definitely sounds like a reasonable thing
to do! :-P

I've recently upgraded pkgs an Opensuse 12.3 + XEN 4.3
(xen-4.3.0_08-264.1.x86_64) server.

It's got two guests set for auto-launch @ boot.

It's been working fine for awhile.  The guest cfg's have not changed in
ages.  Just the upgrade has occured recently.

Now, reproducibly after boot, one Guest is missing,

Those

	"event_channel.c:233:d0 EVTCHNOP failure: domain 2, error -22"

errors are new to me.

Looks like a XEN issue.  I've seen recent work on event channel deadlock
on the dev list, but my xen's logs don't mention anything evtchn-related
since ~ Nov 2011.

Before deciding to file a bug, I need to do some local troubleshooting.

Any suggestions as to what this might be about, or specific additional
info that might be enlightening?

These being failures of Dom0 trying to bind inter-domain event
channels between itself and Dom2, these would quite likely be
accompanied by some log entries from the xen tools or the Dom0
kernel. In any case - the failure message here indicates that the
event channel either wasn't in "unbound" state, or wasn't
intended to be bound to by Dom0. For what it's worth, both seem
pretty unlikely...

Furthermore, you certainly realize that with the update to Xen 4.3,
which isn't part of 12.3, you also got switched from xend/xm to the
libxl based tools, which may be part of your problem. Thus it would
also be important to know what's so specific about this one failing
VM (there ought to be something, or else it wouldn't be always the
same VM that fails to come up).

你好 jian zhang,
我最近对xen arm很有兴趣，所以也关注 xen maillist. 发现除Arndale board 外，你发了一些针对全志A31的patchs。
我刚入手了一块A20(dual A7) 的开发板，我想应该区别不大，所以想把xen 移植 上去。我对xen是新手，所以请教几个问题：
1)  我在xen的主树（http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=summary）的master
branch中看不到你的代码，不知在什么地方？
2）在最新的3,8 以上的linux kernel中没有全志A31/A20的板子支持（只有A1X），不知哪里可以看到最新
针对A31/A20的Linux kernel 代码？

非常感谢！

A20目前社区很活跃啊，你可以关注linux-sunxi mailing list. 其实我也有打算移植xen到A20，只是想买cubietruck(2G memory). 你用的什么板子？cubieboard2, OlinuXino, pad ,机顶盒?

你搜索Bamvor看看。因为我有的patch也不是只针对A31，有些针对A31相关的patch不适合放在xen里面。最终的patch title并不是A31，所以你没搜到？

These are some questions from a virtualization RFP we are responding to at Avaya.  Any help is appreciated.

HV is hypervisor.  These questions are specific to HA + KVM or HA + Xen.

Avaya needs instantaneous failover feature (<250 ms time to failover to backup server and resume service), a hot standby solution for applications in the event of server failure. Does your HV support this speed, if not what is your failover speed? 

 Ideally Avaya would like to have a hot standby solution that continues to use the local storage on the servers, can your HV provide that? If not please detail what the storage requirements are for hot standby HA. 

Ideally Avaya would like to have a warm standby solution that continues to use the local storage on the servers, can your HV provide that? If not please detail what the storage requirements are for warm standby HA.

Please detail resource requirements for warm standby and hot standby failovers. 


Are there maximum core and memory limits, what are range and network requirements between servers? 

Does the hot or warm standby configuration have a performance cost to the application?

Were you using the xl toolstack before the packages were updated?

Do both guests start if you run the xendomains script after boot?  I.e.
disable the script from running at boot, then do '/etc/init.d/xendomains
start' after boot.

Your suspicion of systemd might warrent some investigation

 # rpm -q xen --changelog | grep -A 7 systemd
- Added support for systemd with the following service files
  xenstored.service
  blktapctrl.service
  xend.service
  xenconsoled.service
  xen-watchdog.service
  xendomains.service
  xencommons.service

Perhaps a bit of tweaking on the xendomains script might give some hints
too, e.g.

Yes.  I've been using Xen 4.3 for quite a long time.

Yes, without fail or error.

Aha!.  Just found that, if I edit BOTH .cfg's,

 -    vcpus        = 2
 -    cpu_cap      = 100
 -    cpu_weight   = 256
 +    #vcpus        = 2
 +    #cpu_cap      = 100
 +    #cpu_weight   = 256

then reboot, now BOTH Guests launch,

Those configs most certainly used to be OK and functional.

I can still tweak the xendomains script here in a bit ...

Agreed, Xen should not depend on the external network being up.  But we
are talking about xendomains, which IMO should depend on external
network.  The domains it starts may need that...

i suspsect you'll need, at least, some form of

	cat /etc/tmpfiles.d/xendomains.conf
		D /var/run/xen      0755 root root -   ('root' user
		correct here?)

and

	systemd-tmpfiles --create /etc/tmpfiles.d/xendomains.conf

on install

3), 
doing

    edit /etc/tmpfiles.d/xendomains.conf
        D /var/run/xen      0755 root root -

    systemd-tmpfiles --create /etc/tmpfiles.d/xendomains.conf

here, does the trick.  after reboot,

still have that "(null") rather than Dom0 in its Name, but doesn't

after, append dtb to kernel and i could boot kernel to mounting filesystem.
thanks your help!

i will try to make a initramfs image. do u have some prebuild kernel and fs image for 
testing?

got it. do u plan add some peripheral for A31, e.g. sd, usb...
currenly, i want to make xen dom0 bootup. after this, i'd like to do some sun6i driver
work. if there is a some sort of task list, i could know which one i could do.

Great, you're welcome :)

I don't have a kernel image here, but you can find an initramfs image I
use here

Yes, of course. I've been busy working on the A20/A31 bringup the last
monthes, but as soon as these patches are merged, I'll work on
supporting new IPs, probably MMC in priority.

write blog about how to boot A31 upstream kernel on Mele M9.

title: boot upstream kernel on A31(Mele M9)

# build kernel
there is a [howto](http://linux-sunxi.org/Mainline_Kernel_Howto) describe how to use the upstream kernel for Allwinner SOC. it could be apply to A31(sun6i) too.

after contacts with Maxime, i got the lastest code for [A31](https://github.com/mripard/linux/tree/sunxi-next-a31).

all the allwinner SOC support the arm multi-platform, so i could use multi_v7_defconfig for kernel:

    ARCH=arm make multi_v7_defconfig

the u-boot is got from Mele m9 update image, which does not support device tree. So, i need enable the append dtb:
CONFIG_ARM_APPENDED_DTB=y

    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- make
    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- make dtbs

generate the uImage including device tree blob:

    cat arch/arm/boot/zImage arch/arm/boot/dts/sun6i-a31-colombus.dtb > arch/arm/boot/zImage_dtb
    mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0x40008000 -e 0x40008000 -d arch/arm/boot/zImage_dtb arch/arm/boot/uImage_dtb

if the u-boot is the lastest one, only one comamnd is necessary:

    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- LOADADDR=0x40008000 make uImage dtbs

# build rootfs
[buildroot](http://buildroot.uclibc.org/)

# u-boot commands
