Configuring systemd to restart libvirtd on failure
Mooli Tayer
This will create a respawn behaviour in case libvirt process exits due to nonzero exit code, is terminated by a signal, an operation times out or the configured watchdog timeout is triggered. see http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html ---daemon/libvirtd.service.in | 1 + 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

"Agustin Benito Bethencourt <abebe@suse.com>"_email_"[devel] new openSUSE Team member: Antonio Larrosa"_20130802_1721
Hi,

I am happy to announce that Antonio Larrosa Jiménez joined yesterday the 
openSUSE Team at SUSE. He will work remotely from Spain.  He is not new at 
SUSE since he worked here for a year back in 2000.

Antonio is a KDE developer. Those of you who contributed to that project years 
ago will certainly know him. He will replace Will Stephenson as the KDE L3 
maintainer.

Antonio has been working the last 10 years in a company called Tedial that 
develop a real time backup system for multimedia-tv companies. The last years 
he also teached OS at Malaga College for IT students. 

Until August 9th he is in our offices in Nuremberg.

Welcome back Antonio.

Saludos

company, colleague, virtualization, Mike Latimer
"Jason Douglas <jdouglas@suse.com>"_email_"[devel] New Colleague in Virtualization Team -- Mike Latimer"
It is my pleasure to announce that Mike Latimer is the newest member of 
the Virtualization Team within the SLE Department. Mike lives in Utah 
and will join the SUSE team on the 5th floor in Provo.

Many of you might know Mike from NTS where he has spent nearly 20 years 
doing backline support on various products. We are confident that his 
experience will be a great asset to the team, and will allow him to hit 
the ground running as he transitions to development work around Xen and 
KVM.

Please join me in welcoming Mike to this new position.

Thanks!
Jason Douglas

1, 
modify gic according to Maxime Ripard patch
gic: interrupt-controller@01c81000 {
        compatible = "arm,cortex-a7-gic";
        reg = <0x01c81000 0x1000>,
              <0x01c82000 0x1000>,
              <0x01c84000 0x2000>,
              <0x01c86000 0x2000>;
        interrupt-controller;
        #interrupt-cells = <3>;
        interrupts = <1 9 0xf04>;
};

2, uart0
uart0: serial@01c28000 {
        compatible = "snps,dw-apb-uart";
        reg = <0x01c28000 0x400>;
        interrupts = <0 0 1>;
        reg-shift = <2>;
        reg-io-width = <4>;
        clocks = <&osc>;
        status = "disabled";
};

the following line is important:
        interrupts = <0 0 1>;
it will be pass after changing this.

3, \TODO fix this
