Ok, I've tested the attached patches on xen-unstable and do not see the
races.  I don't see any problem with hvm guests, but there is a problem
with the console on pv guests.  When viewing the guest's vnc console, I
see "serial0 console" and nothing else.  Seems like the guest is waiting
for the console to initialize before continuing booting.  The vfb setup
in xenstore is quite strange too.  xenstore-ls shows a backend vfb path
of '/local/domain/0/backend/vfb/11/-1' with the following contents

       frontend = "/local/domain/11/device/vfb/-1"
       frontend-id = "11"
       online = "1"
       state = "4"
       domain = "sles11sp2-pv"
       vnc = "1"
       vnclisten = "127.0.0.1"
       vncdisplay = "0"
       vncunused = "0"
       sdl = "0"
       opengl = "0"
       feature-resize = "1"
       hotplug-status = "connected"
       request-update = "1"

The '-1' is odd.  I haven't looked into this problem yet, but don't
think it is related to these patches.  IMO this problem is related to
some console initialization bug.

Can you review and test these patches?  I'd like to get the race issues
resolved and patches committed upstream soon.

Thanks!

Hmm, spoke too soon.  When doing save/restore in a loop, I eventually
hit a race between libxlEventHandler() and domain cleanup in
libxlDoDomainSave().

I sent a patch to xen-devel to fix this issue

http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2013-01/msg00137.html

The devid field of vfb and vkb could also have been initialized in the
libxl driver, similar to how we set it in libxlMakeNicList().  But libxl
already sets devid for other devices, so seems the right place to do it
for vfb and vkb devices too.

No need to test the patches.  Maybe we need to rethink this whole
problem and see if there isn't a more elegant solution...

architecture, arm, read ARM_ARM doc, Long-descriptor format
1, system mmu
The field marked as Reserved for System MMU use is ignored by a processor that is using the Large Physical
Address Extension. When a processor is using this extension, the architecture guarantees that the hardware
does not alter this field.
2, Contiguous hint
Use of this hint means that the TLB can cache a single entry to cover the 16 translation table entries.
3, Use of TTBR0 and TTBR1, Long-descriptor format
Table B3-2
introduce T1SZ in TTBCR. it will use with T0SZ. 看起来这个是为了支持大于32位地址空间时，application和kernel可以用不连续的区域。是否在armv7A里面，hypervisor可以利用这个把自己放在高地址？类似x86_64里面user space and kernel space的划分。

if serial device is found, store_serial_port_info will write it to xenstore. So, in my test, xenstore fail is because serial device is not found in qemu. but why? is it mean that libvirt do not give the serial info to libxl? \TODO.

ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2679605/how-to-pull-in-upstream-changes-into-a-fork-using-mercurial
If you cloned the repository from the one you want to pull changes from, you can simply do:
hg pull
If you cloned the repository from another repository, you can:
hg pull <location of repository to pull from>
You'll then need to update your working copy:
hg update
That's the basics, anyway. More details are available in the Mercurial: The Definitive Guide

git, doc, about HEAD,How does origin/HEAD get set?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8839958/how-does-origin-head-get-set
origin/HEAD represents the default branch on the remote. origin's HEAD will only change if you or someone else actually changes it in the remote repository, which should basically never happen - you want the default branch a public repo to stay constant, on the stable branch (probably master). origin/HEAD is a local ref representing a local copy of the HEAD in the remote repository. (Its full name is refs/remotes/origin/HEAD.)

Hi Bamvor,

Please include a "Signed-off-by:" line in your patches. See "Signing
off a patch" in http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Submitting_Xen_Patches

Do you see this problem when you run "./configure --libdir=/usr/lib64"?
See the 4.2 release notes for more information:
  http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_4.2_Release_Notes#Build_Requirements

Matt

2, about libdir
1), my current cmd:
./configure --enable-xenapi --prefix=/usr --exec_prefix=/usr --bindir=/usr/bin --sbindir=/usr/sbin --libdir=/usr/lib64 --datadir=/usr/share
2), i do not notice this. but it could explain why xen4.2 is ok.
3), try it on osc local build.
it is.

3, reply
> Please include a "Signed-off-by:" line in your patches. See "Signing

sorry missing it. i will add it next time.

> See the 4.2 release notes for more information:

I got this issue while using the above libdir, here is my command of configure 
./configure --enable-xenapi --prefix=/usr --exec_prefix=/usr --bindir=/usr/bin --sbindir=/usr/sbin --libdir=/usr/lib64 --datadir=/usr/share
but the LIBEXEC is force set to /usr/lib/xen/bin in config/StdGNU.mk. So, the libdir is /usr/lib64 while libexec is /usr/bin/xen/bin in tools/libxl/_paths.h

meanwhile, the libxl-save-helper is install to "PRIVATE_BINDER" in tools/libxl/Makefile not LIBEXEC:
$(INSTALL_PROG) libxl-save-helper $(DESTDIR)$(PRIVATE_BINDIR)
using the "PRIVATE_BINDER" in run_helper make it coherence with this Makefile.

BTW, these files are not changed after xen4.2, but i only found this issue in xen-unstable.
