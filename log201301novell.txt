Ok, I've tested the attached patches on xen-unstable and do not see the
races.  I don't see any problem with hvm guests, but there is a problem
with the console on pv guests.  When viewing the guest's vnc console, I
see "serial0 console" and nothing else.  Seems like the guest is waiting
for the console to initialize before continuing booting.  The vfb setup
in xenstore is quite strange too.  xenstore-ls shows a backend vfb path
of '/local/domain/0/backend/vfb/11/-1' with the following contents

       frontend = "/local/domain/11/device/vfb/-1"
       frontend-id = "11"
       online = "1"
       state = "4"
       domain = "sles11sp2-pv"
       vnc = "1"
       vnclisten = "127.0.0.1"
       vncdisplay = "0"
       vncunused = "0"
       sdl = "0"
       opengl = "0"
       feature-resize = "1"
       hotplug-status = "connected"
       request-update = "1"

The '-1' is odd.  I haven't looked into this problem yet, but don't
think it is related to these patches.  IMO this problem is related to
some console initialization bug.

Can you review and test these patches?  I'd like to get the race issues
resolved and patches committed upstream soon.

Thanks!

Hmm, spoke too soon.  When doing save/restore in a loop, I eventually
hit a race between libxlEventHandler() and domain cleanup in
libxlDoDomainSave().

I sent a patch to xen-devel to fix this issue

http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2013-01/msg00137.html

The devid field of vfb and vkb could also have been initialized in the
libxl driver, similar to how we set it in libxlMakeNicList().  But libxl
already sets devid for other devices, so seems the right place to do it
for vfb and vkb devices too.

No need to test the patches.  Maybe we need to rethink this whole
problem and see if there isn't a more elegant solution...

company, colleague, QA, Yoonsuk Cho, report to Sebastian Vollath
"Sebastian Vollath <svollath@suse.de>"_email
it's my pleasure to announce a new team member.
Yoonsuk Cho joined the QA-EMEA team in Nuremberg today. Yoonsuk - also called
Brian - has a strong background in IBM's System Z/s390, where he will focus on
within QA.
Please join me in giving him a warm welcome and support him in getting used to
SUSE and QA.

Thanks,
  Sebastian
