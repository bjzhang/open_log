Ok, I've tested the attached patches on xen-unstable and do not see the
races.  I don't see any problem with hvm guests, but there is a problem
with the console on pv guests.  When viewing the guest's vnc console, I
see "serial0 console" and nothing else.  Seems like the guest is waiting
for the console to initialize before continuing booting.  The vfb setup
in xenstore is quite strange too.  xenstore-ls shows a backend vfb path
of '/local/domain/0/backend/vfb/11/-1' with the following contents

       frontend = "/local/domain/11/device/vfb/-1"
       frontend-id = "11"
       online = "1"
       state = "4"
       domain = "sles11sp2-pv"
       vnc = "1"
       vnclisten = "127.0.0.1"
       vncdisplay = "0"
       vncunused = "0"
       sdl = "0"
       opengl = "0"
       feature-resize = "1"
       hotplug-status = "connected"
       request-update = "1"

The '-1' is odd.  I haven't looked into this problem yet, but don't
think it is related to these patches.  IMO this problem is related to
some console initialization bug.

Can you review and test these patches?  I'd like to get the race issues
resolved and patches committed upstream soon.

Thanks!

Hmm, spoke too soon.  When doing save/restore in a loop, I eventually
hit a race between libxlEventHandler() and domain cleanup in
libxlDoDomainSave().

I sent a patch to xen-devel to fix this issue

http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2013-01/msg00137.html

The devid field of vfb and vkb could also have been initialized in the
libxl driver, similar to how we set it in libxlMakeNicList().  But libxl
already sets devid for other devices, so seems the right place to do it
for vfb and vkb devices too.

No need to test the patches.  Maybe we need to rethink this whole
problem and see if there isn't a more elegant solution...

ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2679605/how-to-pull-in-upstream-changes-into-a-fork-using-mercurial
If you cloned the repository from the one you want to pull changes from, you can simply do:
hg pull
If you cloned the repository from another repository, you can:
hg pull <location of repository to pull from>
You'll then need to update your working copy:
hg update
That's the basics, anyway. More details are available in the Mercurial: The Definitive Guide

git, doc, about HEAD,How does origin/HEAD get set?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8839958/how-does-origin-head-get-set
origin/HEAD represents the default branch on the remote. origin's HEAD will only change if you or someone else actually changes it in the remote repository, which should basically never happen - you want the default branch a public repo to stay constant, on the stable branch (probably master). origin/HEAD is a local ref representing a local copy of the HEAD in the remote repository. (Its full name is refs/remotes/origin/HEAD.)

Hi Bamvor,

Please include a "Signed-off-by:" line in your patches. See "Signing
off a patch" in http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Submitting_Xen_Patches

Do you see this problem when you run "./configure --libdir=/usr/lib64"?
See the 4.2 release notes for more information:
  http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_4.2_Release_Notes#Build_Requirements

2, about libdir
1), my current cmd:
./configure --enable-xenapi --prefix=/usr --exec_prefix=/usr --bindir=/usr/bin --sbindir=/usr/sbin --libdir=/usr/lib64 --datadir=/usr/share
2), i do not notice this. but it could explain why xen4.2 is ok.
3), try it on osc local build.
it is.

I got this issue while using the above libdir, here is my command of configure 
./configure --enable-xenapi --prefix=/usr --exec_prefix=/usr --bindir=/usr/bin --sbindir=/usr/sbin --libdir=/usr/lib64 --datadir=/usr/share
but the LIBEXEC is force set to /usr/lib/xen/bin in config/StdGNU.mk. So, the libdir is /usr/lib64 while libexec is /usr/bin/xen/bin in tools/libxl/_paths.h

meanwhile, the libxl-save-helper is install to "PRIVATE_BINDER" in tools/libxl/Makefile not LIBEXEC:
$(INSTALL_PROG) libxl-save-helper $(DESTDIR)$(PRIVATE_BINDIR)
using the "PRIVATE_BINDER" in run_helper make it coherence with this Makefile.

BTW, these files are not changed after xen4.2, but i only found this issue in xen-unstable.

You aren't saying that _paths.h is inconsistent with the actual install
locations for either LIBEXEC or PRIVATE_BINDIR, are you? Just that the
wrong one is being used in the code.

I'm not entirely sure what the intended distinction between libexec and
private-bindir is. We should perhaps consider nuking one or the other.

That's odd, both branches contain 25594:ad08cd8e7097 which is when the
libexec dir changed. I can't see anything else which looks like it would
cause the two to differ.

Ian.

5, from Ian Campbell email, i know that Matt Wilson add the patch for specifying the --libdir in configure.

6, do more test about this.
i fail in xen4.2 either.

yes, i am not. i talking about how to use the path in the code.

i re-test in xen4.2, got the same error in xen-unstable. it is only ok in
xen4.1 in my test right now. Sorry for my wrong report in my last post.
this code(25539:0f1a974bfb38) has beed commit over 6 months. i should
not the only one who encounter this issue. but i do not found anything wrong
in my build and run-time environment.

company, colleague, Chao wei, farewell letter, my leaving
Hi team,

I am sorry to see by how much surprise my decision catch you. I think we have developed a very relationship in the last years and I am thankful for the trust we have in each other by some events and activities whatever in QA team or accross team.

It is important to me that let you understand that I am not leaving because of any reason of the recent past but because I have set for myself a career path and would like to focus on QA management or process stuffs and now is a good time for me to go after that opportunity. Unfortunately, I did not feel that I could reach that goal at Novell and with Ralf and Harald's some offers that would satisfy me and keep me happy.

About the new site leader, I quoted a section from Ralf's mail for your reference.
"In terms of future solution in terms of site manager please let the team know that Ralf is thinking about it and has not yet made a decision and that people who are interested in taking on this additional role should contact Ralf directly via e-mail."

For the Chinese new year show, I will not be available. Please Sunny and Yifan to work with Gracie on preparation.I hope we can perform it well very. I will attend the rehearsing until my last day.

My last woking day will be this Friday(11st, Jan). If you have any questions about site stuffs, you can come to me directly or Claudia and Ralf by mail&IM. For QA part, you can talk to SunYan or Harald via mail&phone&IM.

Best Regards,
Charles

1), reply to upstream. see"14:57 2013-01-06"4.

software, skill, SCM, git send patch howto
1, configure the smtp and git user.
if not, set this in the git send-patch. e.g. i do not add the password in this configuration file, so, i need to input the password during git send-email
[sendemail]
        smtpuser = bjzhang
        smtpserver = mail.novell.com
        smtpserverport = 25
[user]
        name = Bamvor Jian Zhang
        email = bjzhang@suse.com

2, generate the patch file:
git format-patch --cover-letter --signoff -n 2
git format-patch --cover-letter --signoff --subject-prefix="PATCH V2" f5f80cec9e43442d12a445db14e6c01c026d946a
"-n number" could be used while generate the first number of patch.
"--subject-prefix" is useless for the first time.

3, test and send the email
git send-email --no-chain-reply-to --annotate --to xxx@xxx.xxx  --cc xxx@xxx.xxx -cc xxx@xxx.xxx 000*.patch
1), use "--dry-run" for test.
2), usually, "--to" send to list. "--cc" send to the people who may be interested in.  The --cc option must be repeated for each user you want on the cc list.

4, notes: usually, there is guide line in upstream about this. for me, i reference the http://libvirt.org/hacking.html for libvirt patch.
