work report - week 25, 26
1, bnc#815201
1), it could be fixed if update qemu to the lastest one. but update the major version is not allowed and the migration code is changed from qemu-1.3 to qemu-1.5.
2), after some debug, i found that there is a overflow in the clean up in migration. if i fix this, test 30times succesfull. provide the package to reporter for test.
2, US/China virtualization sync.

after debug i know that, bl is wrong. because bl will take the pc+4 as lr, which is obvious wrong. i should set lr through the adr instruction like kernel:
	adr	lr, BSYM(1f)			@ return (PIC) address
1f: 
    xxx

2), BTW, the compile command
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -D__ASSEMBLY__ -include /home/bamvor/sda3/home/novell/work/source/virtualization/xen/upstream/xen_arm/xen-unstable/xen/include/xen/config.h -O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -marm -g -fno-strict-aliasing -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-unused-local-typedefs -fno-builtin -fno-common -Wredundant-decls -iwithprefix include -Werror -Wno-pointer-arith -pipe -I/home/bamvor/sda3/home/novell/work/source/virtualization/xen/upstream/xen_arm/xen-unstable/xen/include -fno-stack-protector -fno-exceptions -Wnested-externs -msoft-float -mcpu=cortex-a15 -mfpu=vfpv3 -mfloat-abi=softfp -DGCC_HAS_VISIBILITY_ATTRIBUTE -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -DEARLY_PRINTK -DEARLY_PRINTK_INC=\"debug-8250.inc\" -DEARLY_PRINTK_BAUD= -DEARLY_UART_BASE_ADDRESS=0x01c28000 -g -D__XEN__ -include /home/bamvor/sda3/home/novell/work/source/virtualization/xen/upstream/xen_arm/xen-unstable/xen/include/xen/config.h -DVERBOSE -fno-omit-frame-pointer -DCONFIG_FRAME_POINTER -MMD -MF .head.o.d -DCONFIG_DTB_FILE=\"/home/bamvor/work_bak/arm/samsung_exynos/linux/arch/arm/boot/dts/sun6i.dtb\" -c arm32/head.S -o arm32/head.o

5, what does AT ( XEN_PHYS_START ) mean?
this specfied the load address.

6, write v2 patch.
1), \TODO modify head.S
is it worth that create a seperated lookup_processor_type function in proc-v7.S?
2), patch 1 commit message
xen: arm: introduce Cortex-A7 support

Introduce Cortex-A7 with a scalable proc_info_list which including cpu id
and cpu initialize function.
In head.S, search cpu specific MIDR in procinfo and call such initialize
function. Currently, support Cortex-A7 and Cortex-A15.

3), patch 2 commit message:
xen: arm: implement early prink for 8250 uart

implement early printk for 8250 uart which is used by lots of arm SOC, such as
Allwinner A31(sun6i) and OMAP5432.

4), finish v2 version, review it again and send it out.

---
it seems that it would better create a common head for both debug-8250.inc and
ns16550.c when ns16550.c is worked on arm soc.

5), send patch
git format-patch --cover-letter --signoff -n2
git send-email --no-chain-reply-to --annotate --to xen-devel@lists.xen.org --cc ian.campbell@citrix.com --cc julien.grall@linaro.org --cc Stefano.Stabellini@eu.citrix.com --cc andre.przywara@calxeda.com --cc bjzhang@suse.com --cc baozich@gmail.com 000*.patch

7, add mode switch patch and test again.
fail

8, todo 
1), try the same thing as Chao baozi, check where it failed.
if it fail after mmu flush, is that mean there is some memory map fail in sun6i?
2), if fail. find out why load/store exclusive fail, is it because other core not started? try it on kernel.
3), do i need to modify mcpu in gcc command?
i guess not. because BIG.little technology.
4), and addr in Makefile.
0x80000000 -> 0x40000000, is it necessary?

1, Huawei has had worked on kvm support Cortex-A57, is it means that huawei'A57 will out on 2014?
[PATCH 0/6][RFC] AArch64 support for Versatile Express using KVM
1), m.hamayun@virtualopensystems.com
The work has been sponsored by Huawei, and developed in collaboration with Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, European Research Center Munich (ERC). A working tree of this implementation is available on the "kvm-aarch64" branch of the following github repository.

https://github.com/virtualopensystems/qemu.git
2), Peter Maydell peter.maydell@linaro.org 
This rather overlaps with a bunch of work John Rigby has already done
(though not yet published to the mailing lists):

https://git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=people/pmaydell/qemu-aarch64.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/kvm-aarch64-wip

so now we need to reconcile the two trees. If you'd let us know
you were doing this a bit earlier we could probably have
coordinated something...

3), Andreas Färber afaerber@suse.de
Andreas join the discussion, because he is a qemu developer.

2, same series patch: about how to pick up kernel headers
Peter Maydell peter.maydell@linaro.org 
Sorry, this bit is wrong; ignore it. We pick the kernel headers based
on $cpu, not $target, so get the aarch64 ones whether we're building
arm-softmmu or aarch64-softmmu.

I wanted to congratulate you on your win for Best openSUSE Project during Hackweek IX.

Your award is one week, so 5 work days, of ITO time.
Please show this email to your manager as a proof that you have received this additional ITO time to work on this project. You can take that time during the next 12 months in agreement with your manager.

Congratulations again on your great project!

Would you be able to send me the email addresses of your external team mates so that I know how to get in contact with them?

virtualization, libvirt, kvm, bnc#815201, save hang, cont6
1, try the same version with report.
1), only update to qemu or update kvm, qemu and qemu-tools.
after check the kvm package, i know that why Martin got the different result.
because qemu-kvm is compile from seperated qemu source. i need to fix this into both kvm and qemu package.

2, reply
Hi, Martin

sorry for the wrong package, i have patch the qemu-kvm in kvm package.
kvm 1.3 is different from kvm 1.5, the latter one is a script calling qemu-system-x86_64. i do not notice this before.
i test 100times pass with this package, including 76times save while vm memory used more than 2Gbytes.

could u please test it again?

BTW: my package version: kernel-desktop-3.7.10-1.1.1.x86_64, libvirt-1.0.2-1.3.1, libvirt-client-1.0.2-1.3.1, qemu-1.3.1-3.4.1, qemu-tools-1.3.1-3.4.1, kvm-1.3.1-3.5.1

do u update other package in opensuse12.3 update?

company, colleague, openSUSE team, Tomás Chvátal, report to Agustin Benito Bethencourt
"Agustin Benito Bethencourt <abebe@suse.com>"_email_"[devel] new openSUSE Team member"_20130702_1519
Hi,

I am happy to announce that Tomás Chvátal joined the openSUSE Team at SUSE 
today, coming from L3/QA Maintenace. He is located now in room 5.16 (5th 
floor), together with Michal Hrusecky, the other Team member at Prague office. 

Tomas has a wide experience in openSUSE since he contributes to factory 
regularly. He is also a Gentoo project Board member, which provides him an 
interesting background in Linux based distributions.

Welcome Tomas.

Saludos
