Cool, thanks for the patch!

In case others are interested, one motivation for adding this
functionality in the legacy xen driver is to avoid xen-only hacks in the
nova libvirt driver.

I think checking the filesystem is the only way to go since xend doesn't
have the notion of managedsave.  Do others see any issues with this
approach?

Thanks for including your test cases.  I've tried these on your patch as
well and looks good!

I think we can do away with the cleanup label and simply return ret here.

name is leaked here if virFileExists() fails.  You can initialize name
to NULL and then unconditionally free it in cleanup.

With exception of the few nits, looks good!  I would like to hear what
others think about checking existence of the managed save image on each invocation of domainHasManagedSaveImage().

1, Lin Ma
1), -CI server.
Contacted Bernhard M. Wiedemann to get some useful information about 
the jenkins scripts in SUSE-Cloud automation project.

Created a local jenkins instance for kvm autotest. defined my own trigger 
policy by creating two scripts:
One script monitors SLE 11 sp3 repo on ibs, if it detects any updates, it will 
analyzes the update info to determine if there is a new qemu-kvm package. 
If so, the another one will get the new qemu-kvm package name, remove
the old package and install the new package. Later,The test jobs will be 
triggered to perform one by one and send out real notification through email.

I've deployed 40% kvm autotests scripts in this jenkins instance. Based on 
aboved trigger policy, they works well. But the rest of kvm autotests scripts 
don't work well, some of them need certain utility packages in guest image, 
some of them need special configuration. I'm working on them to add/fix 
these dependency.

You can configure hermes (https://mercurius.suse.de/ for IBS) to send
you a notification when there's a commit (by mail, rss feed, xmpp
message).

In hermes for OBS, the notifications can also be sent through a raw HTTP
GET query (which would probably be the simplest option for cases like
this, I guess).

implement managedsave in libvirt xen legacy driver

Implement the domainManagedSave, domainHasManagedSaveImage, and
domainManagedSaveRemove functions in the libvirt legacy xen driver.

domainHasManagedSaveImage check the managedsave image from filesystem
everytime. This is different from qemu and libxl driver. In qemu or
libxl driver, there is a hasManagesSave flags in virDomainObjPtr which
is not used in xen legacy driver. This flag could not add into xen
driver ptr either, because the driver ptr will be release at the end of
every libvirt api calls. Meanwhile, AFAIK, xen store all the flags in
xen not in libvirt xen driver. There is no need to add this flags in xen.

Changes since v1:

Still a memory leak here.  I've squashed in the below patch and pushed

And a followup patch to fix a memory leak not noticed during review

http://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=cab0cfd5cfa9c2d2dfa9e04d586211f4db61ae32

I've backported and queued these patches for our next SP2 maintenance cycle,
although not quite sure when that will be.

1, report
Stephan Barth 2012-11-22 15:25:46 UTC

Created an attachment (id=514216) [details]
supportconfig from my lab machine

If a second disk is added to a KVM guest with

virsh attach-disk sles11-1 /var/lib/libvirt/images/sles11-1.img vdb

and then it is mounted on the guest and a single read operation like with

ll /mnt

is done, which is successful and after that the disk is removed with

virsh detach-disk sles11-1 vdb

the guest does not detect this. There is no event in dmesg or
/var/log/messages. Additionally if you run

fdisk -l

the command hangs when it tries to detect the second disk.
2, explain by developer
Bruce Rogers 2012-12-04 20:56:04 UTC

The hot-unplug support is at the pci device level. There is no automatic
notification to the block layer when the virtio pci-device is being removed, so
you do need to have the block device unused when the device is removed (eg
umount <device-file>).

So we do support hot-unplug of the virtio block pci device, but not in the same
way that you have come to expect for scsi, for example. The virtio protocol
does not include mechanisms for handling hotplug at that level, just at the pci
level.

We probably need to document this better.

"Agustin Benito Bethencourt <abebe@suse.com>"_"[devel] Please welcome Alberto Planas - new openSUSE Team member"_email_20121205_1838
Dear colleagues,

It's my pleasure to announce a new team member.

Alberto Planas Dominguez joined this Monday the openSUSE Team at SUSE. He will 
be located in Nuremebrg between 18 and 24 months before moving back to his 
country, to work for SUSE remotely.

Alberto has a wide experience working in different R&D projects and companies 
as researcher, developer or manager. During his 15 year carrer he has worked 
with many different technologies and frameworks (from Assembler to Ruby, from 
JBoss to Django...) in different sectors (Biotechnology, financial) in a 
variety of areas (analysis, tools development, monitoring, modelling...). He 
is also a reputed technical writer with articles published in different IT 
media. 

Please join me in giving him a warm welcome and support him in getting used to
SUSE, across all teams.

By the way, Alberto is very interested in the local culture, history, 
economy....as far as it do not goes through a fermentation process.

Next time I will add this as requirement in the opening description. :-) 
Alberto....stand strong! I couldn't.

Saludos

"Lars Kurth"_email_"[Xen-devel] 2013 Xen event plan's : Call for Input/Action"
Hi everybody,

Next Xen Hackathon - vote on date/location needed
I have been working with a still to be disclosed vendor on a Xen Hackathon to be hosted in spring. The following options are on the table

    Option 1: May 16/17, Dublin, Ireland (preferred by vendor)
    Option 2: 2 days in February 11-14, Munich - note that FOSDEM is Feb 2 & 3
    Option 3: 2 days in March 18-22, Munich

Given that we had a Hackathon in Munich already and that I know that quite a few Xen devs (including me) are on vacation in the middle of March, my preference would be option 1. But I still wanted to put this to you to get a community view.

XenSummit EU, Oct 2013
I just signed the contracts to host XenSummit the week of Oct 21-25 at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre. The exact dates are still to be decided. That time coincides with the 10th birthday of Xen depending on how one counts: the 1.0 release was on Oct 2nd 2003, SOSP 2003 where Xen was presented was October 21 2003.

XenSummit US or Asia, April-June 2013
Given that the EU summit is some time away, it would make sense to host a XenSummit in either the US or Asia in late spring or early summer. Time-frame wise I was thinking of April to June, which should fit well with the Xen 4.3 release. The only problem is that there is no bigger event we could co-locate with. So I can only do this at a) significant cost to Xen.org or b) if a vendor in the community who has space to host 100-200 people and is based in the US or Asia would volunteer to provide their premises for a 2 day event. If you work for a vendor who can accomodate us, and you would be interested in hosting, please get in touch with me.

Best Regards
Lars

2, about MALLOC_PERTURB_ and MALLOC_CHECK_ 
1), MALLOC_PERTURB_
http://udrepper.livejournal.com/11429.html
Seems like the number of people who know this feature is still almost zero. Well, RH developers know it and we have some who use it all the time on development machines. Basically, setting this environment variable causes the malloc functions in libc to return memory which has been wiped and clear memory when it is returned. Of course this does not affect calloc which always does clear the memory.

The reason for this exercise is, of course, to f ind code which uses memory returned by malloc without initializing it and code which uses code after it is freed. valgrind can do this but it's costly to run. The MALLOC_PERTURB_ exchanges the ability to detect problems in 100% of the cases with speed.

The byte value used to initialize values returned by malloc is the byte value of the environment value. The value used to clear memory is the bitwise inverse. Setting MALLOC_PERTURB_ to zero disables the feature.

This technique can find hard to detect bugs. It is therefore suggested to always use this flag (at least temporarily) when testing out code or a new distribution. That's a hint for all the brave souls testing FC6t1.

2), "Jim Meyering"_20110527
please set both MALLOC_PERTURB_ and MALLOC_CHECK_ envvars

Now, bootstrapping emacs on Fedora 15 x86_64
(with env settings as below) fails with a segfault.

If you develop emacs, or even if you just build from sources regularly,
on a glibc-based system, do us all a favor and build with these envvar
settings:

    export MALLOC_PERTURB_=$((RANDOM % 255 + 1))
    export MALLOC_CHECK_=3

Why?  Because that helps you expose malloc-related problems far earlier.
I've found numerous bugs that way.  The trouble is that you have to
be ready to debug, or at least ready to retry with

    env MALLOC_PERTURB_=0 MALLOC_CHECK_=0 make ...

to see if things work better without protection.

Until recently, I've been building like this to work around
a problem that I traced back to a commit in emacs several years ago:

    make bootstrap RUN_TEMACS='MALLOC_CHECK_=0 ./temacs'

However, today, even with that, make bootstrap is failing with a
segfault (in various places) that goes away when I turn off malloc
robustness checking via both variables for the whole process
and not just one of them when running temacs:

    MALLOC_PERTURB_=0 MALLOC_CHECK_=0 make bootstrap

That suggests a very recent change (within the last 24 hrs)
makes emacs act to differently when MALLOC_PERTURB_=N causes glibc
to scribble nonzero (N) bytes into each just freed buffer.

3), MALLOC_CHECK_
Q: 在执行一个程序时，出现如下错误：
*** glibc detected *** double free oｒ corruption : 0x0937d008 ***
是怎么回事？  
A:   设置MALLOC_CHECK_环境变量再运行程序，呵呵，错误信息消失

MALLOC_CHECK_=0   ./myprogram

MALLOC_CHECK_支持如下设置: 
0 - 不产生错误信息，也不中止这个程序
1 - 产生错误信息，但是不中止这个程序
2 - 不产生错误信息，但是中止这个程序
3 - 产生错误信息，并中止这个程序

This is in fact straightforward and is a subset of the existing API.
If we have libxl always call timeout_modify with abs={0,0}, it will
get timeout_occurred when the application's event loop has dealt with
it.  We can simply never call timeout_deregister.

I have implemented this in the 2-patch RFD series I'm about to send.
NB this series has been complied but not (as yet) executed by me...

Ian.
2), Ian C_20121210
> I think this might be difficult to get right without deadlocks.

I took Bamvor's most recent response to mean that a per-event lock was
already in place in libvirt and inferred that this was the reason why
the originally proposed one line fix worked for them. Perhaps I
misunderstood?
3), Ian J reply to Ian_C
Yes, I think that's what Bamvor meant but I don't think it's correct
that such a lock eliminates the race.  libvirt has to release that
lock before making the callback (to follow the libxl locking rules
which are necessary to avoid deadlock).

I'm not surprised that the original patch makes Bamvor's symptoms go
away.  Bamvor had one of the possible races (the fd-related one) but
not the other.

Here (followups to this message, shortly) is v3 of my two-patch series
which after conversation with Ian C I think fully fixes the race, and

And it does.  The event loop lock is released just before invoking the
callback, and re-acquired just after the callback returns.

I'm not sure how to avoid changing the application (libvirt). Currently,
the libvirt libxl driver removes the timeout from the libvirt event loop
in the timeout_deregister() function. This function is never called now
and hence the timeout is never removed. I had to make the following
change in the libxl driver to use your patches

I could also call virEventUpdateTimeout() with a timeout of 0 to make it
fire on the next iteration of the event loop, and then remove the
timeout in the callback before invoking
libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout(). But either way, changes need to be
made to the application.

I had to change this to &ev->nexus->for_app_reg to get it to work
properly. But with this change, and the aforementioned hack to the
libvirt libxl driver, I'm not seeing the race any longer.

"Maximilian Maher <mmaher@suse.de>"_email_"[devel] IP-Migration NOW / SUSE R&D is leaving 10.10.0.0/16"_20121211
Dear Colleagues,

after migrating all servers and the dynamic IP range, OPS-Services  
will finally start today (2012-12-11) to move the workstations inside  
R&D to the new 10.120.0.0/16 address range. The DNS and static DHCP  
entries for the desktop hosts will be migrated to the new range now.

A List of the new Addresses can be found here:
- http://w3.suse.de/~mrueckert/iplist.txt
(list of new addresses for desktop hosts).

Especially for static IP address assignments please proceed as follows:
https://wiki.innerweb.novell.com/index.php/SUSE/Development/OPS/Services/Network
(howto change the setup, mainly DNS, YP and local IP address)

It would be the best if you reboot your machine unless you can make  
sure all NFS mounts from loki (for example your NFS based home  
directory) are freshly mounted on your system (note: a simple  
"remount" will not change the address from which a client has mounted  
something).

OPS-Services is available on #infra at irc://irc.suse.de or via  
rd-adm@suse.de to help with problems.

The only server addresses still active in 10.10.X.X at this moment are  
hilbert, wotan and loki and the old IPs on these machines will be shut  
down by Thursday morning (2012-12-13).

Regards,
Your OPS-Services Team

Supporting multi-platform ARM kernels

Pull ARM soc multiplatform enablement from Olof Johansson:
 "This is a pretty significant branch.  It's the introduction of the
  first multiplatform support on ARM, and with this (and the later
  branch) merged, it is now possible to build one kernel that contains
  support for highbank, vexpress, mvebu, socfpga, and picoxcell.  More
  platforms will be convered over in the next few releases.
  Two critical last things had to be done for this to be practical and
  possible:
   * Today each platform has its own include directory under
     mach-<mach>/include/mach/*, and traditionally that is where a lot
     of driver/platform shared definitions have gone, such as platform
     data structures.  They now need to move out to a common location
     instead, and this branch moves a large number of those out to
     include/linux/platform_data.
   * Each platform used to list the device trees to compile for its
     boards in mach-<mach>/Makefile.boot.

This lets us build a multiplatform kernel for experimental purposes.
However, it will not be useful for any real work, because it relies
on a number of useful things to be disabled for now:
* SMP support must be turned off because of conflicting symbols.
  Marc Zyngier has proposed a solution by adding a new SOC
  operations structure to hold indirect function pointers
  for these, but that work is currently stalled
* We turn on SPARSE_IRQ unconditionally, which is not supported
  on most platforms. Each of them is currently in a different
  state, but most are being worked on.
* A common clock framework is in place since v3.4 but not yet
  being used. Work on this is on its way.
* DEBUG_LL for early debugging is currently disabled.
* THUMB2_KERNEL does not work with allyesconfig because the
  kernel gets too big
[Rob Herring]: Rebased to not be dependent on the mass mach header rename.
As a result, omap2plus, imx, mxs and ux500 are not converted. Highbank,
picoxcell, mvebu, and socfpga are converted.

compiler, gcc, arm, Tuning Performance
ARM Cortex-A15 GCC Compiler Tuning Performance
http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTI0MjI
The ARM options being compared in this article include the stock compiler flags (no additional CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS set) compared to:

-mtune=cortex-a15
This option is very similar to the -mcpu= option, except that instead of specifying the actual target processor type, and hence restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that GCC should tune the performance of the code as if the target were of the type specified in this option, but still choosing the instructions it generates based on the CPU specified by a -mcpu= option. For some ARM implementations better performance can be obtained by using this option.

-marm
Select between generating code that executes in ARM and Thumb states. The default for most configurations is to generate code that executes in ARM state, but the default can be changed by configuring GCC with the --with-mode=state configure option.

-mfpu=neon
This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware emulation) is available on the target. Permissible names are: `vfp', `vfpv3', `vfpv3-fp16', `vfpv3-d16', `vfpv3-d16-fp16', `vfpv3xd', `vfpv3xd-fp16', `neon', `neon-fp16', `vfpv4', `vfpv4-d16', `fpv4-sp-d16', `neon-vfpv4', `fp-armv8', `neon-fp-armv8', and `crypto-neon-fp-armv8'. If the selected floating-point hardware includes the NEON extension (e.g. -mfpu=`neon'), note that floating-point operations are not generated by GCC's auto-vectorization pass unless -funsafe-math-optimizations is also specified. This is because NEON hardware does not fully implement the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are treated as zero), so the use of NEON instructions may lead to a loss of precision.

I did this deliberately because the macro uses token pasting to turn
this into fd_register, at least in many of the uses.

>>Also, not that gcc complained, but register is a keyword.

The token "register" gets pasted together with other things by the
preprocessor before the compiler sees it, so it's correct as far as
the language spec goes. As for it being potentially confusing,
changing what appears here is difficult without changing the names
in libxl_osevent_hooks.

Thanks,
Ian.

When I wrote this of course I forgot to mention that previously libxl
would never call libxl_osevent_hooks->timeout_modify and now it never
calls ->timeout_deregister.

So this change can expose bugs in the application's implementation of
->timeout_modify.

I think this is because of a bug of the kind I describe above.

> - gettimeofday(&now, NULL);
> - timeout = (abs_t.tv_usec - now.tv_usec) / 1000;
> - timeout += (abs_t.tv_sec - now.tv_sec) * 1000;

Specifically, this code has an integer arithmetic overflow.

If libxl calls this function with a value of abs_t which is more than
about INT_MAX/1000 seconds (24 days on a 32-bit machine) in the past,
the calculation (abs_t.tv_sec - now.tv_sec) * 1000; overflows.

And the patch makes libxl always pass abs_t={0,0} which is more than
24 days ago unless the code is running during January 1970 :-).

> - virEventUpdateTimeout(timer_info->id, timeout);

Also, what does this do if timeout is negative ?

Thanks,
Ian.
(2), Ian_J reply to Jim
> Specifically, this code has an integer arithmetic overflow.

If you look at beforepoll_internal in libxl_event.c, near line 859,
you can see how I tackled this same problem there.

Well, this patch is removing that buggy code :).  After again reading
libxl_event.h, I'm considering the below patch in the libvirt libxl
driver.  The change is primarily inspired by this comment for
libxl_osevent_occurred_timeout:

/* Implicitly, on entry to this function the timeout has been
 * deregistered.  If _occurred_timeout is called, libxl will not
 * call timeout_deregister; if it wants to requeue the timeout it
 * will call timeout_register again.
 */

Regards,
Jim

I think you need to have some code somewhere which does the
complicated arithmetic dance to avoid the integer overflow.  Does your
timer registration function have the same bug ?

Well your patch is only correct when used with the new libxl, with my
patches.

I don't understand why you need this.  Doesn't libvirt remove timers
when they fire ?  If it doesn't, do they otherwise not keep
reoccurring ?

the ctx is not valid in libxl__ctx_lock. maybe it is because the timeout issue mentioned by Jim?

Jim: those go away if you make the &ev->nexus->for_app_re change to Ian's patch.
Jim already mention it in http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2012-12/msg00937.html
after this save still hang(it is what we expect).
